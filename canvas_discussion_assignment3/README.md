## Process
Note: As C goes up less points are counted, regularization is inversely proportional to C. But, the higher the alpha value, the stronger the regularization, the more points are counted.
I started by looking at how the default alpha value (alpha = 0.0001) does. This one is already doing very well. There is little regularization here.
