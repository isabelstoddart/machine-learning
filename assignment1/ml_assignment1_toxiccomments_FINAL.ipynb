If a study is old it does not mean it is not quotable and if a study is recent does not automatically make it a ground breaking study. If you as an adn=ministrator want to ban the article, go ahead an do it. Who cares about this Wikipedia site when it is managed by administrators like you. That is why it is said that little knowledge is a dangerous thing. Go ahead and ban me or whosoever you want to and ban this article. Next time when Wikipedia appeals for its users to sign the petition so that it  not banned I will think twice because now I know it is run by some arrogant and biased people. You do not even know how to talk on the social site. i will be waiting for this candy on Halloween aka your ban, jerk. Sitush has mentioned as on March 6th 2012 somewhere else on Wiki site that he would read all the sources available in 3-4 days and then reach on a conlusion about this articel. he must be genius that he will read all these references  written over such a long period of time and then decide in 3-4 days. What was he doing prior to March 6th and if did not ahve all the knowledge why was he suggesting corrections. It proves how biased he is?\n",

(Un)Fortunately, more Albanians wound up dead than Serbs. Blame KFOR, not us. Anyways, non-existant? I guess it was just school teachers and babysitters who went insane on Serbs in 2004, and have been attacking them ever since and well before. Yes, that would explain it. Anyways, didn't the so called KLA become Kosovo's new \"\"defenders\"\" (or murders)? Aren't they controlled by the government? Wouldn't it be right assume that what they do what is handed down as an order by the Kosovo government? Funny, who else does all of Kosovo's drug dealing, and human trafficking? The UN?

I find it astounding that you have gone to great lengths to supress my views by blocking me from editing, blocking me from contacting the head as well as yourself and for added measure you have blocked me from emailing. All because I complained about my treatment, lets face it the excuse about me edit warring is just a smokescreen, you just don't like it when I diagree with a point of view. Are you following the orders of Blixx and co? Yet you make no mention of their personal attacks and abuse on me - they have called me 'a nasty piece of work', 'an islamist', 'Haddad's puppet' etc. Have you even warned them? I think not.

      "Yeah well, I didn't appreciate Kelapstick's snide \"\"you've been here for years and should know better bullshit\"\". As I made clear I am not an admin and can't move articles over redirects. I can't nominate an article for deletion in userspace, it tells you it has to be an article space. I can't have a redirect deleted when it's contentious. So I did my fucking best and he can take his snide comments and shove em. I had to do another AfD and it's still not right because it doesn't show the previous ones. It's a colossal waste of my fucking time and I don't appreciate it. The article has been moved all over the freaking place wily nily including into my userspace where someone who is not welcome on my talkpage shouldn't mucking about. The consensus for the article is clear as it was in 2012. So this whole escapade is an exercise in futility. And then we have your other buddy Hafspajen jumping in with his nasty innuendos and repeated accusations of bad faith. So you want to rein in the incivility? Go for it Drmies. But don't get made at me for telling the truth. When you guys create a mess and involve yourself in it and muck it up, and you get stuck doing mopping I don't break a sweat. Cry me a river. I don't create articles in bad faith EVER and I don't edit in bad faith EVER and I try to keep a sense of humor about all the attacks I face, but I don't like it. So if I hurt your feelings, good. You deserve it. Show your fellow lowly editors a little respect in the future and don't act like such arrogant wp:dicks. Does that article still exist? I remember some fascinating debate about it. I'm sorry if you have to eat your own pudding on occasion. Next time order something else.   \"\n",

The information i have graciously added to the wikipedia foundation is valuable and can benefit more people then u can ever imagine so please next time you do something similar to this to other people have the common sense to stop because i seriously recommend for you to see a neurologist, you have a serious problem.
