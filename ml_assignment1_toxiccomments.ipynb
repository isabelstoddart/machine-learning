Last I checked there is no WK:Retribution rule that lets you trash other users simply because they are not following the rules. So, according to your reasoning, if I break the rules, then it is okay for you to break the rules. You are a hypocrite. You are acting like the official Wiki vigilante who can go after people that you feel aren't following the rules here. I broke the rules. But now YOU broke the rules too. So I guess we are both guilty of doing nothing to get the article unprotected. If you want to help build consensus on forum then you need to show respect to. If you feel like someone is not showing respect on this board, that doesn't give you the right to show them disrespect back.

Turks are the eternal optimists, I'll give them that, I have never met a Turk who wasn't a Nationalist or an Islamist or a Militirist. The sad thing is Turkey's territorial integrity will eventually collapse in on itself, Turkey is an Eastern Country, yet it tried to have Eastern 'heart', with the Western 'mind', it went for double or nothing and now it will lose everything, you cannot rely on a far right military which despises EU demands to stop persecution of the Kurds to protect your Constitution Turkey, we are entering endgame, and I will be only too glad to gain revenge for what these filth did to my Uncle 31 years ago, I will bathe in your blood Turks, I will burn villages to the ground and pour salt over once fertile land.

      "\" Welcome to Wikipedia!  I'm glad you want to get involved, but I'm afraid there's a problem with the article you created,   Stanley Quatavis Mitchell.  It did not indicate how or why the subject is notable, that is, why an article about that subject should be included in Wikipedia.   Don't feel too badly; lots of people have a little trouble when creating their first article.  You might find it useful to read Your First Article for some good advice about starting to create articles on Wikipedia.  Two important rules of thumb are: Avoid  writing about yourself, your business, your family and friends, or your web page, and avoid writing about anything that hasn't been written about in reliable sources like books, newspapers, and magazines.  Anyway, don't be discouraged.  I've deleted the article you created, and feel free to ask me if you have any more questions.  If I've made a mistake, and this article really is about a subject that meets the notability criteria, then please let me know my leaving me a message and links to at least three newspaper articles, magazine articles, or books that have been written about the subject, and I'll be glad to undelete it, and even add the sources so no other patroller makes the same mistake.  - (talk · contribs) \"\n",

      "Originally born in OHIO,and raised on a yuppie farmh in a small town outside of dayton, ohio. Her mother is a professional and has worked for the government for almost 30 years and her father is retired.   Traci was raised on staage at the age of 2 starting with ballet then tap, then jazz.... she was a natural on stage..... throughout her childhood she was in pagaents and sport like softball, volleyball and track in high school, she competed in many events: Miss Wright State of OHIO,All American Drill Team.\n",
      "\n",
      "After Traci graduated, her love of dance and people took her to a business college, where she studied basics in business management.  Then she learned ins and outs of banking and later took on another degree in Medical Techology. She also did promotional work for , bartended , ran local bars and competed in bikini contests for extra funds.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1996, Traci started lifting weights with a friend and saw a photo of Marla Duncan winning a national competition. Her beauty and physique impressed her enough that she wanted to try what she was doing - Fitness Competitions. At the time she was developing some problems medically and noticed herself gaining some weight.   Traci thought weight training would help but she found that because she is a natural she responded almost imediately to the weights which caused her to get pretty stocky and very strong quick.  She was still eating normally but when it comes to bikini contests you need to be lean and feminine.... well this is when the Army Soldiers took a noticed to her.  She was at Ft. Hood, TX and was left alone because a lot of times soldiers are away for months to years and she was pretty shy meeting others because she had always been very much independent.  So she decided to check out while in studies some competitions related to the Army.  This is where she found out about obstacles course contests... so she knew she was strong and stocky so maybe this would be better for her.  So she entered her first WTF competition with little or know training and out of 100 girls made nationals in top 10. but something happened ... she started noticing her weight wasn't changing and she was developing back problems and fatigue.   She had always had problems with being healthy as a kid and seemed to get sick a lot.  Her Father was always on her about bundling up.  One day her discomfort and taken so much that she ended up in the emergency room... this is when she found that her bowels had backed up into her system and she was lucky because if was really serious... the only time she had ever dealt with hospitals is with her hearing... she had lost her hearing at four along with being sick all the time... and at 17 had to have implants put in which was a miracle cause it gave her 80% back... but she is still considered hearing impaired... now this is happening to her... she had gained a weight up to 180 and looked very stocky... the doctors didn't know what was wrong with her.... she spent three days being detoxed so to speak... when they didn't know if she had lupus, rheumatoid, but later found traces of cancer in her colon... but she didn't let it get her down. So she reenrolled in school again for more college degrees towards nutrition in NC.   Up until 2002 she only competed for fun, not as a money making career. In 2002 she was honored with several titles in many organizations like Hawaiian Tropic, Venus, Ms Fitness and Sport Aerobics and WTF.. it wasn't til she had heard she was on ESPN2 every month for one year and honored on the front page of her local newspaper and found herself in several articles in OXYGEN. This helped Traci realize that she had potential to earn some actual money in the fitness industry. She kept competing and in April of '2002 moved to an organization which she had heard was tough and very different from others called NPC /IFBB.  This is where Arnold S. Slyvester Stalone and many more came out of you know the BOYS CLUB Once she arrived, competing in her first NPC she had found a very different way they handled threi shows and treated the competitors... Shoop coming from a strong female in charge background family life saw that this was going to be a challenge for her... she had dreamed of maybe getting more exposure and getting the chance to really be friends with some of the hollywood celebrities.  During the time she was studying nutriiton she always had more than several ideas and projects in mind to bring to the future.... now she has alwsy felt competing natural was always her best route and found with no help and little support she was able to conquer her enemies and achieve her goals.  She was always wnadering why thes other girls who seemed to get covers and major sponsors did it... where she found herself funding everything on her little $7 an hour because she as a military spouse never made as much in those cities because the husband was the provider she was tired of the little she wanted bigger she knew that s\n",

VirtualSteve and myself closed articles which had been recreated against consensus, the recent AfD offered no opinion on any individual article and was a reaction to the mass nom (which, while I supported, I did not initiate nor did I think it was the absolute best way to resolve the situation - though as it has gotten the right people talking to each other, may yet result in progress).

The edit war policy states \"\"Edit warring is the confrontational, combative, non-productive use of editing and reverting to try to win, manipulate, or stall a content dispute.\"\" Strangely enough that sounds an awful lot like what you're threatening to do. You've certainly got a check on the \"\"confrontational\"\", \"\"combative\"\" and \"\"non-productive\"\" criteria. Redirecting and merging are editorial decisions which can be performed in the usual manner and the threat to revert attempts to do so is truly stunning. As is the arrogance implicit in the statement that you'll return to lecture us poor shmoes on how to do merges and redirects the \"\"proper\"\" way. 8| You don't have any more authority here than any one of us and your behaviour regarding this subject has been outrageous and disruptive. I haven't had anything to do with you before this so I don't know if this is an aberration or if it is how you usually behave and approach dealing with other editors and fellow admins but if it is, as emails I've received since my email to the mailing list would suggest, there are serious concerns about your behaviour that will need to be addressed. As a co- (by 5?!) Vice President of the Wikimedia NY sub-chapter you really ought to be setting a far better example and not acting like an arrogant bully-boy, standing over people who are discussing ways to resolve this, and threatening to revert good faith attempts to clean up a mess, which even you yourself have said needs to be cleaned up. You really should know better and I'm appalled by your behaviour. Sarah \n",

      "Oh yes, there are quite a few ways to handle that sort of thing. At its simplest, click on the history tab to see a list of all the edits made to an article in reverse chronological order.

Now click 'edit this page' and in addition to the normal edit box you should also see a warning at the top that you are editing an out of date version of the page. That's OK, in this case it is what you want. Don't make any changes to the text, just enter an edit summary like 'reverting to last good version by xxxx' or 'rv test', press the 'save page' and you are done.\n",

You can get a similar page by clicking the 'diff' link from your watchlist. Then clicking on 'Revision as of 22:15, 9 September 2005' at the top of the left panel, will take you to the earlier good version, and you can make a null edit and save as before. The advantage of using this page difference approach is that there are also links to go forward and back to newer and older edits. So if a vandal has made a series of bad edits you can keep stepping back until you reach a good version of the article before editing and saving to revert to that version.\n",

However, if you are reaching test4, its a good idea to get an admin involved because the next step is to block them.\n",
      "If you have the time, you can also check the user's other contributions to see whether they have been messing up any other pages, and if they have, revert those pages too. However, if they look like being a particularly busy vandal, its usually best to get help from an admin at Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress, because admins have some extra 'rollback' buttons to make it much easier to undo a large number of changes.\n",

I agree that the article could use revision in the introduction.  I don't really like the proof, either. Only a very small number of people will understand it, and for them there is a simpler, shorter proof under similar assumptions: by algebra the variance of a sum is proportional to the number of summands, and so the variance of an average decreases as the number of summands increases.

For instance, if a guy plays for Colorado in the 2006 season and is traded to Columbus before the 2007 season begins, only 2006 is listed.  But if a guy plays for Colorado in the 2006 season and is traded to Columbus during the 2007 season (June, say), both 2006 and 2007 are listed as years for his Colorado tenure even if he didn't play a match for Colorado during 2007.

      "That is a matter of opinion, but with 4 blatantly wrong CSD tags out of 17 - nearly a 25% fail rate - you're not even in the game, let alone the ballpark. You are wielding CSD as a blunt instrument, tagging first and thinking about it later. It needs to be used much more as a surgical instrument. Furthermore, although you removed CSD tags in two cases, even after being told about here on this page, you have not gone back to the user talk pages and apologized and/or removed the CSD tags. No, we aren't discussing an attempt at perfection here; we are discussing competence and civility. You make a big point out of demanding civility from others posting on your talk page, but what you don't understand is that what you are doing is a pretty serious form of incivility. In addition to the CSD taggings, you are picking new articles and adding all sorts of problem tags to them instead of actually building content. Again, I ask you - instead of tagging articles, how about adding content to them? An example of a newly created article I did that with, Django Walker, was listed at DYK. When I first saw it, it was nominated for CSD. We are here to build an encyclopedia. Are you?  |  talk  \"\n",

I agree the FT quote \"\"wasn’t well informed in politics\"\" is very surprising given his position. I'm happy with you removing this, and will ponder if there is a better way to give the info.

      "Even supporters acknowledge his political ambitions, suspecting he plans to anoint himself leader of the country’s liberals. The armed forces he now purports to lead are successors to the Gaddafi-era military he repeatedly turned against; the Islamist militias he is fighting are the ones with which he fought in the 2011 uprising. Many wonder whether he is a committed democrat, as he claims, or just another Arab military officer with dictatorial ambitions, in the mould of Egypt’s Gamal Abdel Nasser, Syria’s Hafez Assad and Gaddafi.You need someone tough like Haftar to step up to the outlaws,” says the commentator Abdel Hamid el-Jadi. “He has experience in the Libyan military and he knows the tribes. If he has political ambitions we’ll deal with that in the second stage.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But others worry about what they describe as a brittle personality and myopic worldview. Of nearly two- dozen people who have had dealings with him and spoke to the Financial Times, none could identify any of his interests outside war. In meetings with exiled opposition groups in the US and Africa, before he returned to serve as the rebel army’s chief of staff in the 2011 uprising, he spoke only of his military expertise. “He wasn’t well informed in politics, relationships between countries or cultures,” said one Gaddafi-era opposition activist.Many Libyans and international experts fear the offensive that Mr Haftar is co-ordinating could further destabilise the country. In televised appearances, he has a habit of conflating the Islamist militias with members of parliament and the government who belong to the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood, and with al-Qaeda.''\n",

      "Ok, the argument regarding the Brandenburg class is this: What distinguishes the Dreadnought type from a pre-Dreadnought? As I understand it from the article the only requirement is the uniform main battery in bore diameter and barrel length. There is a whole list what the advantages are and the only ones the Brandenburg class did not meet due to the different barrel length is maximum range (the difference is nearly irrelevant in 1890 due to fire control abilities) muzzle velocity and thus flight time and splash distinction (irrelevant because of the low number of differing guns and the missing central fire control at this time). Dreadnought labeled ships had 6 inch guns as secondary armament while the Brandenburg had only 4 inch ones as next biggest after the main guns. The maximization of striking power on long range has to be seen in the context of the time, the long range is the maximum of guns and fire control, also the power of HE does not depend on muzzle velocity but on caliber (as used in the article, which was the same for all of the 6 guns) and even the Japanese used HE 15 years later with their big guns...\n",
      "The other advantages of the armament rest on \"\"caliber\"\" as used in the article (see \"\"#Main armament power and caliber\"\"), not on barrel length, like logistical simplicity. The fire control advantage from splashes is there for only 6 guns, and if 2 shells arrive even a bit later, it is even better for distinguishing shots with the non-central firecontrol in use at this time. The rate of fire was uniform and about 2 shells per minute as stated in the Brandenburg article, no problem there as well.\n",
      "What about the rest of the design features of Dreadnought according to the article? Central fire control was not implemented in all the \"\"Dreadnought types\"\" and if it was used, then to very different degrees. The position of the main armament on the Dreadnought itself was not optimal with the wing turrets, the Brandenburg was more advanced with only centerline turrets. That there were problems like the blast damage was not uncommen, Dreadnought ships had wet guns and so on as well. The armor was undergoing heavy changes before and after the Dreadnought, the Brandenburg class had composite armour, the all-or-nothing scheme came later than Dreadnought and the armor deck (plunging fire) was thicker on Brandenburg than on the Dreadnought 15 years later. The turbine was not used by early US Dreadnoughts and coal was used on much later British ships.\n",
      "Interesting how ships not even having the same caliber (as in the article without barrel length) are mentioned as being semi-dreadnoughts and the Brandenburg class 15 years earlier only lacking the uniform barrel length but coming much closer to the \"\"Dreadnought description\"\" in many other aspects than actual early Dreadnought is totally omitted...   \"\n",

The reference clearly refers to a \"\"close air support\"\" version of the F-16 and not a \"\"ground attack version\"\", and I changed the article to reflect as such.  The irony is, even though this close air support version was cancled, the F-16 has engaged in close air support (CAS) in every major conflict (for the U.S.) it has flown in, up to and including present day operations in Iraq.  Your definition of ground attack is skewed.  Ground attack can be many things, including CAS, but also things such as interdiction, where high speed can be very much an advantage for a ground attack aircraft, to help avoid defenses. \n",

Secondly, Galilee would not have been exempt, since even virtually autonomous cities like Apamea in Syria were not exempt despite having almost complete self-governance.

Collectonian's point is surely that keeping a list article with the combined tables of contents of all the issues is an honor that we accord to very few magazines. I personally believe that it's justified in the case of Mad, because famous publications deserve more coverage than obscure ones. Irrespective of Collectonian's particular viewpoint, a high-quality list article with lots of references is easier to defend against future requests for its deletion. I haven't studied this one enough to know how it could be improved, but I think your new intro is a step in the right direction. I hope to post again on the Talk but haven't had the time yet. \n",

      "\n",
      "In the 'Aftermath' section, it is noted:  In losses of aircraft and experienced aircrew, the battle was a blow from which the Luftwaffe never fully recovered. It had significantly fewer bombers at the start of Operation Barbarossa, some 929 machines, because of losses sustained over Britain.Bergström 2007, p. 129.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not sure if that is what Bergström, who is being referenced here, actually writes, as I do not have access to his books. I doubt it, however. The Luftwaffe frontline strenght certainly did not decrease as a result of the Battle of Britain, as reinforcements and production was more than sufficient to replace losses, and, to replace the existing types with more modern type of aircraft, withdrawing the older models (ie. by the start of Barbarossa, much of the 109E fleet was now replaced by the new 109F).\n",
      "\n",
      "It is also contestable on grounds of Luftwaffe reported strenghts. Olaf Groehler, in 1975, for example reports the LW frontline strenght (not including a lot of aux. and non-combat oriented units) gives the LW strenght as 5298 on 11 April 1940 (before the Western Campaigns), of which 1356 were S-E fighters, 1711 being bombers and 414 being dive bombers. A day before Barbarossa, 21 June 1941, he reports 5599 aircraft, (ie. some 300 aircraft increase) including 1440 S-E fighters, another 263 in a new category, the night-fighters, 1511 bombers and 424 dive bombers. Therefore the claim that only 929 bombers were in the Luftwaffe (which I suspect is a misunderstanding of the original text) is wrong, as is the conclusion that this was due to some 'irreversible blow' suffered during the BoB. It may well be that 929 or so bombers were employed against Russia, while the others elsewhere in the West and in the Med. In any case, the claim that the BoB was some sort of a death blow to the LW lacks solid foundation. It certainly suffered considerable losses, as did the RAF which lost apprx. 100% of the fighter and bomber force it started the Battle with, but even in absolute terms those losses were not irrecoverable; the LW already lost about the same number of aircraft during the two months of the Battle of France as it did during the four months of the Battle of Britain; yet it was was capable of launching the BoB offensive just a month later, as it was capable of seizing complete air dominance over the Eastern front in 1941. Therefore I think that particular sentence is contenstable and should be removed.\n",

Besides, it is neccessary to distinguish the rites of episcopal consecration and of coronation. Celestine IV received episcopal consecration in 1238, three years before his election to the papacy, because in this year he became bishop of Sabina. He died before coronation, but not before episcopal consecration. Stephen was not a bishop when elected pope.\n",

The first point to make is that the only remaining delete view was made before the article was improved and still refers to its former state. The keepers asserted that the sources met WP:N. No-one in the discussion argued against that assertion. The fact that coverage is from a regional newspaper in no way invalidates it for the purposes of WP:N. Also, notability is an absolute standard - there is no requirement that any member of a class of articles (no pun intended) is distinctive from other members of that class. In my view, a merge is a version of keep, and that that was the appropriate close but I wouldn't argue if the article should survived as a no consensus.\n",

      "\":Both in current numbers (24%) and in historical context, Roman Catholics are a minority religion in America. Even among Christian \"\"believers\"\", the ratio is more than two to one in favor of Protestants. This is no suprise: of the 13 colonies, only one had a significant Catholic presence (Maryland). Today, of the 24% Catholics, most (about 12-14% of the country) are now Catholic hispanics, mostly in California, Texas, and Florida (probably more, with undocumented Mexicans). The remainder are mostly Irish and Italian Catholics, in the Northeastern cities. Likewise most Protestants in the country are segregated, and live in the South and Midwest. There is a religious segregation in the country that muddies the appreciation of the \"\"other\"\". Of the Protestant/Reformation movement, most are mainline or evangelical/born again/fundamentalist churches. Orthodox are not a Reformation faith, but Mormans and Pentacostals probably trace origins through the chaotic, developing Reformation movement. Of the 20% not now calling themselves Christian, most are agnostic (probably with mostly Protestant roots), but some are Muslim, Jewish, or have Asian-rooted faiths. The main things apparently affecting religious population size are: Mexican immigration (Catholic), mainline Protestant church attendance and birthrate (declining), conservative Protestant activism (increasing), intermarriage (tending toward dominant faith of partners or agnosticism, ergo all \"\"conservative\"\" churches, born-agains, opus dei, othodox jewry increasing). In sum, Roman Catholics may be a plurality denomination (24%) compared to next largest (Baptists), but a Christian faith/movement smaller in size by half than the Protestant/Reformation movement, and again, in historical context in America, not a surprise. -2 November 2005\n",

      "Georgewilliamherbert's reason for blocking me relied solely upon the idea that i personally attacked Nableezy by accusing him of \"\"supporting terrorism\"\". from an absolutist POV, nowhere in any edit was the word \"\"terrorism\"\" even mentioned. my observation that nableezy's political POV on wikipedia aligns with the political goals of hamas was by no means meant as a personal attack, nor to insinuate the more abstract idea of nableezy's support for terrorism. my primary intention was to highlight nableezy's possible WP:COI with the subject while he was pushing to have negative information about it removed. my main point here is that i find george's reasoning for my block to have been rather arbitrary and ambiguous.also, the duration of the blocks handed out seems somewhat irrational. nableezy, a user with a lengthy history of often thinly veiled and sometimes outright personal attacks not to mention numerous complaints about their civility, was given only a token block of three hours for a direct personal attack . whereas i have no significant or pertinent history of incivility and was blocked for 16 times that length (48 hours) for what some have misconstrued as a personal attack based on the wholly fabricated idea that i called someone a \"\"terrorism supporter\"\". not to mention nableezy plainly knew that his blatant personal attack would result in a ban, where i went to some length to clarify that my comment was not a personal attack. also, i did not respond when nableezy attacked me directly, and i was the first user to drop the argument and bring the discussion back to the topic at hand .i really cannot stress enought the fact that i never accused nableezy of \"\"supporting terrorism\"\", not only did i never directly say this, it was never even implied by my comments. thus it would seem my block was based entirely on a misconception of what was meant when i said \"\"nableezy displays his affinity for the palestinian cause, and by association hamas\"\"  implying this was actually instead intended to say \"\"nableezy displays his affinity for the palestinian cause, and by association terrorism\"\". this is simply not the case, and frankly i am somewhat offended myself at george's insinuation that i would arbitrarily class\n",

After all, while he may think that (if the allegations are true) it is a minor offense, obviously other people (e.g. Ace or Patterico) no doubt think it is quite damning.  So I think it's better to avoid the debate about how serious a matter the allegations are if true, and not comment on this which probably accounts for a relatively small part of the ink/pixels spilled on the story anyway.  I have the sense, CWC and Michael Snow, that you disagree with me and you seem like quite reasonable folks.  If either of you think it's better to put in back in, I'll respect that.\n",

I have seen this picture, and the picture shown on this website is neither the same picture, nor is it a picture of the same personage. The claims that this photograph is a photograph of Baha'u'llah are false. The person in this photograph bears no physical resemblance to the personage in the photograph on display in the archives. Their ages appear to be the same, so the dissimilarity in resemblence cannot be ascribed to age differences in the same person.\n",

Quite frankly, all this debate is quite ridicules. I respect the Baha'is right to respect the Manifestations of God by not portraying their images publically, but they seem a bit too defensive. THeir all worried about showing his picture publicaly, and this isnt even his picture. Apparently this picture has been distributed, even among Baha'is. These people havent even seen the picture in the archives. I cannot emphasize how different in appearance the two personages in the two photographs are. Why do you think they never show the archives picture online? Or never show the two photographs together? Because it would be obvious that one of them is a false picture.\n",

      "There has been a long-standing issue with Irvine22, primarily on the PIRA page, but also on others.  Irvine22 has been confirmed as a puppetmaster for the purposes of block evasion, refused to acknowledge or apologize for the incident, and then began to implement a series of disruptive, POV edits without discussing the matter on the talk page.  His edits have been almost universally reverted, and yet he continues to make them, after being told many times by many editors as well as one admin to raise issues on the talk page first.  He shows no sign of ceasing this behaviour, nor will he acknowledge, much less address, any criticism of it.  The page's resident admin, User:Rd232, suggested that I raise the matter on the ANI page if it continued, so that is what I am doing now.\n",

      "Following is a small sampling of Irvine22's more recent edits.  Note that I have only selected edits for which there was no consensus, that were later reverted.

They also occurred after he was repeatedly told not to edit the article without first seeking consensus, or at the very least providing an adequate source.  \n",

      "Yes, that's probably the best way to view the development of that article. However, I can't go into that much detail myself because I certainly don't have the time to do that much research. That quote from Iliad is rather odd. Homer seems to be refering to Hesiod's earlier Theogony; but the details are different. The Perseus Digital Library (whose pages take some time to load; so for anybody reading this, be patient) translates Homer's quote just as you say (line 14 onwards), and has this to say for Theogony (line 720 onwards). I'm no classicist, but I'd be weary of that bit of text - it is certinly odd and probably should not be taken at face value so naïvely. As you say, everywhere else (as far as I know) he refers to the underworld as the \"\"domain of hades\"\". As for Erebus, the quotes from Iliad (under the heading: 3 from Homer, Iliad), at face value, seem to indicate that it is a place. But this is merely a misunderstanding of what Erebus is. Erebus is the gloom, the darkness of the underworld, the \"\"place of dark mists\"\" as you put it. Replace \"\"Erebus\"\" with \"\"darkness of the underworld\"\" or the like and the quotes make just as much sense as the assumption that Erebus is a physical location. However, I don't know of any source that explicitly states that it is a location in the underworld; so, again, where does that quote come from?  \"\n",

      "One of the things that bugs me about the writers who claim that the Midwest accent is the standard American accent is their fishbowl view. They view their own accent as the correct one. What do you think somebody from Georgia or Texas would think of that? Is this another \"\"to the victor goes the spoils\"\" from the Civil War? The north gets to have the \"\"correct\"\" accent? The population of southern speakers is barely a minority, I'd hate to be from Louisiana and hear some egomaniac from Iowa talk about his accent being the right one. It's like the woman who says the toilet seat should be down, even though 50% of the population uses it the other way, she thinks her way is the right way. Newscasters generally speak with a northern accent, I can attest to that, but they come from all over, and how many of them are deliberately trained to speak like a Midwesterner? I can't imagine such a thing. Would a newscaster from Albany NY or Seattle, or LA, or Connecticut, where people all have basically the standarn northern accent, need to change to some sort of cornfield Nebraska twang? Hell no. The Midwestern accent is not really typical anyway, I lived in Michigan for a year and people have an unusual accent there, not the typical newscaster accent. They say everything is \"\"the bomb,\"\" but they pronounce bomb as if it were spelled \"\"bahm.\"\" Their accent may be the bahm, but is NOT the standard way to pronounce things in journalism. I would say that of all the places in the USA that have the most neutral speach, that journalists would try to emulate, this region where I live beats out the Midwest for neutrality. Eastern upstate NY, from Poughkeepsie to Syracuse. Also Connecticut, they hae no trace of the New England weirdness that you see in Vermont or Maine, or most of Mass. And northwestern Mass has the Vermont accent. Very little of Mass is free of the weird New England thing. Worchester, forget it...very thick there. Probably the only accent-free part of Mass. is around Springfield, or southwestern Mass in general. That's like Connecticut, which is neutral. The Vermont accent is only found among the older people. Young kids in Vermont are not carrying this on at all. The old timers with their \"\"Pepperidge Faam Remembas\"\" accent with all the \"\"ayaah,\"\" well that was a Swedish accent and the grandchildren of the Swedes don't talk that way anymore. Not at all. As for the NYC accent, that only goes as far north as Peekskill unless you count all the transplanted NYC folks, especially after September 11, who moved upstate by the millions lately. As far north as Poughkeepsie, there are a good number of NYC folks that moved up, but the native Poughkeepsie people have the basic American accent, and the children of the NYC folks lose their accent in one generation. North or west of Albany, there are very few NYC transplants and no accent at all, except for the rednecks. And what can you do about the rednecks?  \"\n",

However, who should write a book on the topic? Someone who has no experience with it? Storms isn't simply editorializing, expressing his opinions, he shows the basis for those opinions with meticulously referenced text. As with any review of the field, he cites research according to his opinion of what is relevant, and this, then, gives us a guide to what is notable in the field. There are thousands of peer-reviewed papers on cold fusion, and even more  much more  if we allow conference papers. He can use conference papers, we can't, but if he cites them, that makes them sufficiently notable for our reference. Because of the position of the field as to \"\"general opinion\"\"  very unclearly defined  we have to present everything in the field as controversial, including what is quite well-established, such as excess heat. If you don't think excess heat is reasonably well-established, you should read the 2004 DoE review again, and I could cite reliable sources that the work is sound. The claim that it's all junk research, quite simply, can't be supported from any solid source, only from what are, really, tertiary sources as Hipocrite is now using at the article, in place of the much stronger Storms reference, which is a secondary source.

In other words, OCMV, I'm quite with the 2004 DOE review, except that the field has shifted since then, the evidence for nuclear effect is stronger, a clear and consistent pattern has emerged from a review of all the research, such that negative replications typically, now, can be seen as confirmations of a general hypothesis forming, but no clear proof that the basic process is fusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the SPAWAR group shows energetic neutrons. The work is solid and published. Aspects of it have been confirmed, and I am, indeed, assuming that there will be more confirmation; their work, over almost twenty years, has been quite solid and conservative, they've done proper controls, etc. The levels, however, are very low, and this kind of phenomenon has always been used as an argument against cold fusion: there are all these apparently contradictory experiments. I was just reading yesterday one protest that \"\"all these experiments produce different amounts of heat, how come there is no consistency?\"\" \"\"So what if you find neutrons, this is inconsistent with the reported heat.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Actually, it isn't. What that shows is that neutrons aren't involved in whatever is generating the heat, but that the energy source, what I call the black box, is capable of creating conditions where a little hot fusion takes place. For example, take the Be-8 hypothesis. That will generate energetic alphas at 23.8 MeV. These can cause some hot fusion to take place at a low level, indeed, it would be expected. The alphas are found, confirmed, Miles et al's work showed, way back, that helium generation is correlated with excess heat. No excess heat, no helium. Excess heat, helium, in an amount proportional to the excess heat, and the ration is at 25 +/- 5 MeV, as reported by Storms and others. Krivit thinks this is a bogus figure, but I'm not convinced that Krivit understands the problem. If you don't capture all the helium, you will get a higher figure, and that is, indeed, what is found, but with some experiments, great care has been exercised to detect all the helium, and that gets us tightly toward the expected figure from d-d helium fusion, 23.8 MeV.\n",
      "\n",
      "One writer put this way: Fleischmann didn't just discover some isolated island, that could be specified by simple coordinates, he found an entire continent, and those who try to find the island find different things, their reports vary all over the map, literally. We do not know to what extent low-energy nuclear reactions are possible. Storms details a list of observations that it would be desirable for a CF theory to explain. This does not mean that he thinks all these findings are artifact-free.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elemental transformation under conditions that produce the excess heat phenomena is now quite well confirmed, overall. The field suffers from a lack of highly specific confirmation; this results from the conditions under which the work has been done. Researchers don't want to, at this point, waste their time doing exactly what everyone else has done, they want to\n",

      "Today, WTHR consistently dominates every news timeslot.  WISH has been a close second except at 11PM where CBS has helped WISH move ahead. WTHR is also one of NBC's five strongest affiliates for primetime and news programming, ranking up with KUSA-TV in Denver and KSDK in St. Louis. This led to speculation that NBC Universal could buy the station from the Wolfe family and become NBC's first O&O; in Indiana and change to \"\"NBC 13\"\".  However, NBC Universal recently decided that it only wants to own stations located in larger markets, selling four owned-and-operated stations in several mid-sized markets to Media General. The most likely purchaser for WTHR is thought to be the Gannett Company, which owns KUSA-TV.  \n",
      "\n",
      "It should be noted, however, that the Wolfe family tends to own businesses for the long-term.  Wolfe family businesses are profitable and carry very little debt, thus there is little incentive to sell.  The Wolfe family controlled BancOhio Corporation, once Ohio's largest bank holding company, for nearly 70 years.  The Wolfes also controlled The Ohio Company, once Ohio's largest brokerage, for nearly as long.  The Wolfes have owned The Columbus Dispatch since the late 1800s and have been in the broadcasting business since the 1920s.  The Wolfe family's last remaining interests are in the media and in real estate, thus it is highly unlikely that they are actively looking for buyers for WTHR.\n",

Why do you say \"\"of course\"\" (as EU brings nothing good) and if you look e.g. to England or Poland, most parties are Anti-EU (which does not mean, they want immediately a withdrawal), and that's \"\"of course\"\". It are simply facts. Most parties in Europe are Anti-EU, but even if not, why would that be a reason not to mention the parties who speculate about withdrawal?? And why would non-winning in elections be a reason not to mention them?? They seek EU Withdrawal or a major reform or opt-outs for their nations. But as you say, you don't want they have weight, because you simply do not tolerate other opinions about the EU and wanna have your LibDem-Pro-EU-Opinion (which is anyway evil) in the article and undermine the parties who want real freedom and independence (though in fact, we Anti-EUists do not have opinions, but knowledge). Second, all that would give WP a very bad name, which you don't wanna, though it has anyway a bad name yet as WP is a non-neutral center-left pro-EUSA propaganda platform. But you may be right with the fact, that the party-lists are already better explained in the article Euroscepticism (while \"\"Euroscepticism\"\" is also rather a pro-EU valuating name, better would be \"\"Eurocriticism\"\" or \"\"Anti-EUism\"\") which would but not be a reason to delete the lists, but to delete this whole article and simply redirect to Euroscepticism and transfer the other information. But I would say, it's better to have two seperate articles and this one with both lists.   \"\n",

      "Regarding you two non-Urantia Book reading nerds - Wazronk and Richiar - if you play games with what you don't know, then you're in for a fight. First of all, you two idiots, if you even bothered to look at the Urantia Readers-Intl website, you would know that it is not an advertising site, but a legitimate non-profit Urantia organization. Because you are not a member of the Urantia movement, and if you were, we would know who you are, you do not even know the history of the Urantia Readers-Intl - which by the way has a larger dedicated following then either the now falling apart Urantia Book Fellowship, and the failing Urantia Association International. \n",
      "\n",
      "For your edification, the Urantia Readers-Intl is the original Urantia Brotherhood from 1950, and the only group still holding the flame of the original Doctrine of Trust from its creation. The Urantia Book Fellowship created itself in 1989 as it broke off from the Urantia Brotherhood and the Urantia Foundation. The Foundation created another group called the Urantia Association International for some ridiculous reason, because they had the legal rights to the Urantia Brotherhood organization, and still do. Nevertheless, the Urantia Association International, as in the same direction as the Urantia Book Fellowship, fell into bad management and nefarious direction, and lost sight of the original Midwayer mandates. As such, the true remaining \"\"loyalist\"\" migrated from the Urantia Brotherhood to the Urantia Association International. \n",

As such, the \"\"loyalist\"\" members to the Urantia movement, many of whom where members of the Urantia Association of Florida, grabbed the torch and reorganized the original Urantia Brotherhood as the Urantia Readers-Intl. Because you two dummies are not a direct part of the Urantia movement, and again we say this because we would know who you are if you were - you do not know who is who and what is what. You don't even know that the Urantia Book Fellowship is a counter Urantia movement organization. But, you are obviously not true thinkers, but that is not the issue. \n",

So, if you put the Urantia Book Fellowship link back in, and keep ours in, the we keep yours in. Because you've pissed us off, if you place the Urantia Book Fellowship link above us, we will place our link above you. This is in retrospect to your piousness. So suffer with it. That's life, and perhaps maybe one of you two idiots will someday realize who the Urantia Readers-Intl really is, who the Urantia Book Fellowship really is, and who is the original group with the original doctrine - but we already know that you two bozos don't have what it takes to figure this out in this life time. The truce is... Urantia Readers-Intl first, Urantia Book Fellowship second, Urantia Association International third... at least for now, then maybe someday we'll swap order, just to appease the dark side.

      "The above statements about the essences of Nichiren Buddhism are which sects did what is a partial explanation; it is clear that it was composed respectfully by someone sympathetic to a particular sect, SGI.  SGI has a powerful voice around and world and has historically represented Nichiren Buddhism to important world leaders who sought it's understanding.  There are at least 2 other schools of Nichiren Buddhism: Nichiren Shu and Nichiren ShoShu.  These sects warn of SGI (but do not prohibit) it's practice; many feel that SGI inherently contains certain personality-cult rituals, and too frequently worship President Ikeda (the current leader of SGI) along with Nichiren and Shakyamuni Buddha.  Nichiren himself has said that he was not a Buddha, but an incarnation of Jogyo Bodhisattva.  The path of the Lotus Sutra is the path of the Bodhisattva  one who delays their own enlightenment until all other sentient beings in the universe have been saved from suffering.  Schools like Nichiren Shu do not believe that the priest should not be worshiped, nor the president, only the Dharma, the Wonderful Flower of the Lotus Teaching.  Several western nations have placed SGI on their respective \"\"Cult watch\"\" lists, and in extreme cases family members have written letters to their governments for assistance in getting their relative de-brainwashed.  This is only in extreme cases with several exigent circumstances.\n",

      "LittleOldMe, I agree with you on this issue. It is not POV to say Chavez is a Mexican-American. It also doesn't single him out. The primary argument against the edit seems to be that his mexican heritage somehow detracts from him. This does not seem to be a viable argument. First, you assume there is a negative connotation to being from a mexican heritage. To assume some people might view this in a negative light ignores the reality that any statement on a page can be looked at in a negative light by a person. The fact you list Chavez as an American will cause some people to look at him in a negative light. The same issue occurs with him being a union leader (people are against the union). Second, you ignore the fact far more reliable sources, dealing with far greater issues of a need for nuetrality have \"\"labeled\"\" him as a Mexican American. If the library of Congress can refer to him as a mexican american, why not wikipedia? The library of Congress is a reliable source, and not POV. It seems to me that the exclusion seems to be POV, in that it is pushing an unkown agenda. I don't know what the agenda is. Third, didn't Cesar Chavez in \"\"Cesar Chavez: Autobiography of La Causa\"\" describe himself as a \"\"mexican american working to help other mexican americans.\"\" He had duel citizenship (both USA and Mexico). Doesn't any of this matter? These are facts, not POV.\"\n",

If one defines the French colonial empire as the possessions of France outside metropolitan France than the empire still existed with Overseas departments and territories like Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Guiana and others.

      " I encourage you to read that essay carefully. WP is a great resource. It is an amazing resource. It is additionally useful, helpful, unprecedented, and perhaps even world changing! I love it, that's why I volunteer my time here to improve articles and direct people to resources that can help answer their questions. But none of that makes it reliable, not in WP's own terminology. The scientific theory article is a great example. That's actually a pretty good article. And it's useful for many purposes. But the definition is presented too simplistically, and it makes it seem that all theories are generally accepted as true explanations of the world, and that is not the case, as is demonstrated by the phlogiston theory. And that example is confusing, but there are also many many inaccuracies and outright incorrect statements on WP  I know because I've fixed a few. Some are accidental, some are malicious, some will be soon fixed, but others linger. Another thing to remember is WP is always a work in progress. A true scholar should evaluate the reliability of every source. That is why I keep directing you to the SEP. That article is written by highly esteemed professional philosophers of science, who we know are educated, trained, credentialed and accepted in that community. Likewise, textbooks are vetted by editors and publishers, and academic journal articles go through peer review to help ensure that correct information is presented. That is part of why they are WP:RS. In contrast, WP is the encyclopedia anyone can edit. I can assert to you that I'm a professional scientist, with over a hundred citations in peer-reviewed journals to my academic articles, and a PhD in math, and maybe that will help convince you that I know what I'm talking about. But I'm not going to bother to prove that to you, and you can't really be sure that I'm not making that stuff up ) While we attempt to distill our reliable sources into good articles, sometimes that gets messed up. If you read the entirety of the SEP article on scientific theory, you will see that it does not support the sentence which cites it in our article! I don't know how that happened. But it will just sit there wrong until someone notices and has the time and energy to fix it. And even then, some well-intentioned editors may resist the change, and revert. And maybe it's not even wrong. Maybe some RS do reserve \"\"theory\"\" for widely accepted theories, and would instead say that we should rename the Phlogiston theory to \"\"the former Phlogiston theory\"\" or something else! So then we'd have to do a whole re-write, explaining several different notions of what a scientific theory is, and then it might make the article less useful for the casual reader. \n",
      "For 99% of lay use, the issue of reliability may not matter. And surely using WP's sources to cite in papers is a great idea - but you have to make sure that you read and understand them yourself, and don't depend on what WP says they say. If my life depended on it, I would not trust anything on WP, unless somehow I had no other sources available at all, and hence no choice. So no, WP is not reliable. But that doesn't mean it isn't great. Cheers,    \"\n",

It's interesting that you ask that the slate be cleaned.  I see nothing on my slate.  If Decius wishes to, he can start by offering apologies for calling me all these horrible insults, and most especially the \"\"weasel\"\" part, which came even after his olive branch (the hypocrisy of it!).  He should apologize earnestly, unreservedly and abjectly.  Unless he does so, I will have every right to be calling him \"\"the Window Urinator\"\" (his words, not mine).

Also, he apparently doesn't know as much relevant law as I do, even if he did attend two years of law school.  What I left on his user page was not a specific threat aimed at him.  Hell, it wasn't even a threat.  It was a description of my feelings.  Also he apparently lives in Chicago, and I live in Southern West Virginia.  Threats across state lines are almost never followed up.  Cops have better things to do.  I could have told him I actually wanted to kill him, and the police still would not do anything.  Except offer a totally useless restraining order.  I guess I have the practical knowledge he lacks.  And if they did something, which is about as likely as me winning the next Powerball?  I'd just be placed in a mental hospital on a 72 hour hold, and that ain't no thang!  I chuckle, however, at the thought of a dishevelled cross dresser shambling into a police station reeking of BO and Mad Dog, Lubriderm and semen, and saying that someone threated to kill him.

It's not; when used as such it's imprecise shorthand. You call the phrase \"\"British Isles\"\" Victorian; but of course it is much older than that; and the ancient origins of all this terminology vastly predates the modern political situation (even if we define \"\"modern\"\" as meaning \"\"the past millennium\"\").\n",
      "\n",
      "The deeper question, of course, is whether you have a terminological objection or a geographical one— do you object merely to the phrase \"\"British Isles\"\"; or do you object to the whole notion that these particular islands can be considered together as a set? Because, see, I think it's pretty obvious at a geographical level (far before humans arrived to hurt each other's feelings) that the islands can reasonably be considered a group. But once we consider them as a group, we have to call them something. I don't think any alternative to \"\"British Isles\"\" has much currency.\n",

      "I understand that for some Irish people the phrase rankles; but if they think that the phrase, when used by people from the UK, is full either of arrogance or ignorance or triumphalist glee, I'm quite confident they're mistaken in thinking so. Certainly in the rest of the world, outside those two countries, \"\"British Isles\"\" is a phrase used constantly and frequently by well-educated people who are fully aware of the two countries / two islands involved, and who have no emotional investment in their sometimes strained history.  |  talk \"\n",

      "Oktay Sinanoğlu (born on August 2, 1934 in Bari, Italy) is a Turkish scientist specializing in theoretical chemistry and molecular biology. In his autobiographical book which titled \"\"The Turkish Einstein Oktay Sinanoglu Book\"\"[1] he describes himself as: \"\"A person who was the world's youngest professor in the last 300 years,\"\"[2] \"\"at the peak of the science in the U.S.A.,\"\"[3] \"\"a man who reached the level to say, \"\"I'm God\"\" in science,\"\"[4] \"\"the Lord of the U.S.A.,\"\"[5] and \"\"The Turkish Einstein.\"\"[6]\n",

      "Sinanoğlu was born on August 2, 1934 in Bari, Italy, where his father (Nüzhet Haşim Sinanoğlu) served as a consul general. In 1939 - at the beginning of World War II - the family returned to Turkey. He graduated high school in Turkey in the year 1953. This high school's name was \"\"Ankara Maarif College\"\" since 1951.[7] The courses in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology in this school had been given by English teachers in the English language since 1949.[8][9] Sinanoglu learned the English language very well in this high school.\n",

      "Serving American Military Intelligence at the age of 18\n",
      "\n",
      "In his autobiographical book entitled \"\"Turkish Einstein Oktay Sinanoglu Book,\"\" which was published in Turkey in the Turkish language (first printing in October 2001 and 70. printing in April 2011, a bestseller: 150,000 copies), he stated that, in the summer holiday 1952-1953, he applied to the JAMMAT \"\"Joint American Military Mission for Aid to Turkey\"\" (renamed JUSMMAT in 1958)[10][11][12] to get a job as a translator. His application was accepted by the U.S. Army Staff in Ankara, and he was sent on duty to Erzurum as translator for Secret G2 Military Intelligence Agents Sergeant Kowalski and Sergeant Peterson.[13] After graduating high school in 1953, a scholarship was given to him by the Fulbright Program to study chemistry in the United States.[14] According to the agreement, students were elected by the U.S. Education Commission in Turkey, but funding of the scholarship was provided by the government of Turkey, because Turkish students will return after graduation in the U.S.A to become teachers in Turkey. Sinanoglu was sent with this expectation to the U.S.A.\n",

      "\n",
      "He arrived in New York on September 25, 1953.[15] According to his autobiographical book mentioned above, he stayed one year in Missouri [clarification needed], after which he went to California and graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1956, with highest honors in chemical engineering. Afterwards, in eight months, he earned a Master's degree with highest honors from MIT (1957); and after this, in two years, he finished his doctorate at the University of California, Berkeley (1959).[16] Subsequently, he finished a one-year postdoctoral research appointment at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, University of California Berkeley (1959-1960).[17] So, his pupilage ended in 1960.\n",

      "Violating Scholarship Agreement and Military Service Obligation to Live in the U.S.A.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the 1953 scholarship agreement, after graduation, Sinanoglu was obligated to return to Turkey to teach chemistry to Turkish students.[18] Sinanoglu stated in his autobiographical book that: \"\"Returning to Turkey to teach chemistry to Turkish students in the English language was worse than death, a horrible and dishonorable thing. İnstead of this, to stay in the U.S.A. and to teach chemistry to American students in the English language was a more honorable thing. I swore that: I will not return to Turkey; I will stay in the U.S.A and I will be a chemistry teacher in American universities.”[19] So Sinanoglu violated the 1953 scholarship agreement and did not return to Turkey. But there was a second problem: According to the military service obligation laws of his country, after finishing his studies in 1960, Sinanoglu was to return to Turkey to fulfill an 18-month military service obligation. The penalty for violating the scholarship agreement was a fine: the payment of a sum of money. But the penalty for violating one's military service obligation was the cancellation of one's passport and visa; this penalty could not be paid by money in those years (1960s). He stated in his autobiographical book: \"\"Theoretical Physicist Feza Gursey wrote a letter to me inviting me to the Middle East Technical University which was being established in Ankara, Turkey. But I couldn't return to Turkey because of the military service obligation. If I went to Turkey, I would be a soldier for 2-2,5 years.\"\"[20] An easy way to stay in the U.S.A. was to marry and father a child in that country.\n",

How does a government decide how many credits ought to be issued (for free, I assume) to each entity before trading begins?  Indeed, most questions about emissions trading boil down to this very question.  For example, if an auction is used, and the auction is efficient, economics would predict that no trades would take place post-auction (the occurrence of such trades would imply that the auction had been improper)  making the whole concept of \"\"cap and trade\"\" actually mean \"\"cap via auction\"\".  I don't mean any of this as criticism.  But, as Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, I think it's failing to fulfill it's job here by dodging the most policy-critical aspect of the issue.

If you have, then you would know that claims of Fascism being anti-clerical is absurd (the position of individual anti-clerical self-professed Fascists is irrelevant to the ideology of Fascism itself). You would have to resort to conspiracy, as the would-be scholars have, and claim that Mussolini's ideology of Fascism was all a huge front and that he secretly was anti-Clerical and secretly considered anti-Clericalism intrinsic to Fascism. How convenient. And as for Darwinism, which was my other point, you won't find anything on that either. Mussolini never even stated anything about evolution (nor did Hitler, for that matter).

      "He’s one of journalism’s most beloved and respected men, but someone appears to have it in for Tom Brokaw. \n",
      "Look up the former NBC News anchor on Wikipedia and you’ll find a review of his Emmy-winning reports, his best-selling books, his 20 honorary degrees. Until recently, you also would have found this sentence: \n",
      "“He had been married to Meredith Lynn Auld (a former Miss South Dakota and author) from 1962 until 2007, when an alleged affair between Brokaw and Diane Sawyer ended their marriage.”\n",
      "The Brokaws’ marriage is very much intact (a Google image search shows them arm in arm at events throughout 2008 and 2009). Likewise, ABC News’ Sawyer remains happily married to director Mike Nichols.\n",
      "A rep for Brokaw said he “burst out laughing” when he heard about the supposed affair. Contacted in the arctic reaches of Finland, Sawyer sent back word through her rep that, “as cute as Tom is, she laughed so hard she nearly fell off the icebreaker she’s traveling on.”\n",
      "The purported affair, anonymously added to Brokaw’s bio on Feb. 27, was deleted after five days. Wikipedia Foundation spokesman Jay Walsh tells us the post “would constitute a ‘vandal edit’” but doubted the vandal could be found.\n",
      "“It’s an open system,” says Walsh. “People may use it to exert their views. But the biographies of living people are most scrutinized by our volunteer editors. It’s incumbent on the Wikipedia Foundation to make sure they’re accurate.”\n",
      "Walsh surmised that “someone with some agenda” was behind the post. Or maybe there’s more than one person. Clicking on the discussion page of Brokaw’s bio reveals attempts to slip in digs about his accent and personality. Wiki watchdogs rejected the insults, though not the unflattering picture of the newsman, which reminded one reader of “Clint Eastwood saying, ‘Do you feel lucky, punk?’ ”\n",
      "The effort to smear Brokaw recalls the anonymous Wiki attack in 2005 on former assistant attorney general John Seigenthaler Sr., who, it was falsely claimed, masterminded the assassinations of both John and Bobby Kennedy.\n",
      "Brokaw isn’t the only newsman targeted by Wiki vandals. “Some of our correspondents have stalkers who constantly post falsehoods,” says a source at another network news department. “We’ve had Wikipedia block posts from repeat offenders.”\n",
      "But the unflappable Brokaw isn’t calling for any investigations. Through his rep he said, “This is beneath comment.”\n",

Actually, I can accept trading a 48 hour block for still being allowed to express my feeling towards some of Wikipedia's greatest flaws when it comes to the wiki-police and how it is common for a gang of users to ridicule others without fully studying the facts simply because they do not have the time and/or are enforcing some policy written by the wiki-police. There is a reason newbies are reluctant to become regulars on Wikipedia and most editors that have edited Wikipedia for as long as I have, just basically retire and walk away. What is funny is that during the asteroid re-direct discussions of March and April I was not even around to discuss the consensus that developed. I did not make a single edit to Wikipedia from March 5 to May 1. It will be a great loss to Wikipedia content (vs the wiki-police force and policies) if editors like myself leave because members such as Padenton are allowed to group attack people without bothering to properly look into the facts. Perhaps I should move my near-Earth asteroid work over to a SETI website, but then I would probably have to leave Wikipedia to prevent being further accused of a COI with my edits. After all, Wikipedia itself is NOT a reliable source, it is the verifiability of the reliable sources.\n",

      "\n",
      "Overview:\n",
      "Presently, ACORN is under FBI investigation for massive voter fraud and other serious  crimes in connection to the 2008 presidential election directly concerning Barack Obama  who was one of its principles. It's a matter we take very seriously,\"\" FBI spokeswoman  Bridget Patton told the Associated Press. \"\"It is against the law to register someone to  vote who does not fall within the parameters to vote, or to put someone on there  falsely.\"\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Acorn is the largest of a plethora of radical left wing groups with more than 1,200  neighborhood chapters in 110 cities across the country with a national budget of $37  million who's sole purpose was to suddenly prior to the election spring into action  after quietly building up over the years to gerrymander the 2008 presidential election  through massive voter fraud. However, they claim to be nonpartisan but are radically  left wing with actual communist memberships. Most of their funding comes from U.S.  government grants. Further, to that end their intentions were to bring in and harbor  hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens from various countries and placing them in HUD  public housing and \"\"choice\"\" voucher programs awarding free houses to illegal aliens at  taxpayer expense while wantonly neglecting the disabled who desperately needed housing  thereto. This was coerced into action through legal threats to these agencies citing  civil rights laws. \n",
      "\n",
      "Through these intimidations, using civil rights laws it further precipitated first the  collapse of the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac when these impossible  mortgages collapsed in the fall of 2008 along with the other forced \"\"minority\"\" bad loans  at HUD which led to the collapse of the mortgage industry starting a domino effect that  led to the failing of all top five investment banks on wall street and the mess we are  in today in February 2009. The government initiated \"\"bailouts\"\" (really government  theft) and gifted itself nearly ten trillion dollars in \"\"stimulus packages\"\" as an  excuse to fix this smaller two hundred billion dollar bad mortgage problem. Most of  this on debt to China who has precipitated this by pegging the dollar and implementing  grossly unfair trade practices initiating monstrous trade deficits and debt we will  never rise above. Although President George Bush(R) played his share in ridiculous  deregulation, ACORN with backing from Barney Frank(D) the chairman of the House  Financial Services Committee which oversees housing and banking industries really  initiated the whole debacle by forcing these ridiculous minority loans.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The case details: \n",
      "95% of polled U.S. citizens object to illegal immigration and open boarders.  Nonetheles, Maricopa County Arizona is a microcosm, analogues to how the influx of  illegal and legal immigration is causing huge population increases raising serious  questions about their rising undue influence upon our elections, particularly the  election of Barack Obama of late and the fairness, legality and constitutionality  thereof as assessed by CNN and announced by prime-time television CNN anchor Lou Dobbs  upon his analysis of the latest census figures ramifications. Such is the case because  in Maricopa County, much like other counties in the United States population not  citizenship determines voting districts. And there's clear, mounting evidence that  both illegal and legal aliens are replacing long time residence and partisans using  people that can't vote as \"\"filler people\"\" to fill up the extra people needed to make up  a given district along with the people that favor their political party. Such is  particularly the case because the census figures don't distinguish the difference  between legal and illegal aliens and most of the illegals are coming across the border  from Mexico who is actively investing in and interfering in our electoral process.  v=8oTQoZifckU&feature;=related \n",
      "\n",
      "Polls in Mexico indicate that the majority favored Obama and the election results  showed clearly that such \"\"minority\"\" voters such as \"\"Hispanic\"\" and \"\"African American\"\"  voters overwhelmingly voted for him and clearly won the election for Obama.

      "For the record, it was a simple spontaneous eruption of contempt mingled with rage. Some have muttered that I went to his page to harass him; that's not the case. I went to continue a discussion that had been interrupted by earlier admin action. Some are muttering that I went there to \"\"bait\"\" or \"\"poke\"\" him into a block. I appreciate the complement but my Machiavellian intelligence is non-existant. Obviously. \n",
      "\n",
      "I lost respect for Malleus when he said, \"\"You already succeeded in getting me blocked, so I can only presume that you're trying to repeat the trick.\"\" I had made it clear that I had no intention of getting him blocked, he knew it, and yet regurgitated this populist slur. That's where he opened the door for my unmitigated opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "But my rant wasn't aimed at the dishonesty I perceived in that comment, that simply gave me permission to express a much deeper revulsion that's been building in me over the last few months with respect to this project. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's a feeling, so I'm not sure I can make it clear. A kind of nauseous disgust. It's to do with how we deal with the hurt we may cause others, other editors, our subjects and our readers. I'm pleased to see the faltering steps being taken toward a more civil ethos here. Those who actually know me know that means a great deal to me. There is a long way to go. Pesky pointed out that finding the right form of words for what's required is difficult. I agree. That's the challenge. The right form of words will emerge if we discuss these questions enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "With regard to respectful discourse between editors, Malleus has been addressing the real root of the civility problem here for years. Telling someone to fuck off, or calling them a cunt is obviously uncivil and an easy call for an admin. But the real evil here is not Malleus and me calling each other names, it's the sleazy aside from one editor to another, undermining the reputation of a third. One editor can bully or badger another for days or weeks without ever calling them a name, and it's their victim that cops a block when they respond accordingly. So I'm glad to see more admins taking civility seriously, but you're going to have to work on the sophistication of your approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm disgusted by the way this project treats its readers with regard to controversial images. The bit that disgusts me is the mantra that \"\"we don't care if we offend our readers.\"\" Seriously. That has been repeated ad nauseam during the Muhammad images debates and others. I can see no excuse for that attitude, and don't want to participate in an enterprise that has that attitude towards its readership.\n",
      "\n",
      "And finally, contempt for our subjects. I first noticed this on a BLP. A teenage girl and her boyfriend made a sex tape. Later, when she was a minor local celebrity, the tape was posted on the net, without her permission. It's there now; Google her name and \"\"sex tape\"\" and you got it. She's now won a TV competition, so is becoming better known.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tape's existence has been mentioned a few times in the press, but not much, and usually the \"\"nudge, nudge, lucky bastard\"\" type of comment, but it doesn't seem to have affected her career or even her private life. An RfC asked \"\"Should we mention the tape?\"\" Policy-wise you can make a case for its inclusion, but it's borderline. What really disgusted me was the utter unconcern of many editors for the effect our inclusion of the factoid would have on the visibility of the tape, and the consequent effect this would have on the woman. I won't elaborate further; you either get it or you don't.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it was concern for the subject of a BLP that brought Malleus and me together. He was arguing for the preservation of a borderline notable BLP that the subject said was distressing him. I argued that it should go, simply because it's borderline notable and the subject doesn't want it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Although Malleus asserted the wishes of the subject are irrelevant, an assertion he is incapable of justifying, and a position I find morally repugnant, he deemed it appropriate to also declare the subject's claim of distress is implausible. Unfortunately, Jimbo had already primed me with a similar judgment. Jimbo had ignored my response, so I thought I'd add a little emphasis when I explained my view to Malleus.\n",

      "\n",
      "1) Anti-sidetone circuit\n",
      "\n",
      "Meucci began investigating topics related with the telephone \"\"system\"\" in 1858, as shown by a drawing of the same year, reproduced below http://www.chezbasilio.it/immagini/corradi_drw.gif. \n",
      "This drawing formed the basis for Meucci's caveat of 1871, but, as Meucci's lawyer did not file it with the caveat, it was later notarized by Meucci himself in his affidavit of 9 October 1885.The drawing shows a two-way, simultaneous, telephone conversation, with a complete separation between the two directions of transmission (indicated by arrows). This contrivance is aimed to counteract the so-called \"\"side-tone\"\" effect, that is, the hearing of the echo of the speaker's own voice (as well as any background noise) in his own receiver. \n",
      "This layout is known today as a \"\"four-wire circuit\"\". With it, Meucci anticipated any other inventor, as proved by the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "No mention of side-tone effects, nor measures to counteract it, are found in Bell's patents, nor in Gray's caveat, both of 1876. In the first Bell's subscriber lines, the four (initially, two) instruments were simply put in series on the same line.\n",
      "The first anti-sidetone (AST) circuits were introduced by the Bell people in the 1900s, particularly by George A. Campbell, with his nine patents of 1918, many decades after Meucci's solution was shown in this drawing, and over thirty years after the same drawing was notarized.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Inductive loading\n",
      "\n",
      "The drawing reproduced above http://www.chezbasilio.it/immagini/lemmi_drw.gif is taken from a note jotted down by Meucci in his Laboratory notebook on 27 September 1870, and reported in an affidavit by M. Lemmi of 28 September 1885, containing the English translation of said notebook (see also my paper on \"\"Antenna\"\").\n",
      "It can be seen that diagrams \"\"No. 2\"\" and \"\"No. 3\"\" differ from \"\"No. 1\"\" in the insertion midway along the long-distance line of an inductor (with either a horseshoe or bar iron core). In diagram \"\"No. 4,\"\" the inductor is split into two parts, inserted at both ends of the line. In his notes, Meucci pointed out that, in this way, he could get rid of the battery, and that, by splitting the inductor, he obtained better results.\n",
      "This technique is known today as the \"\"inductive loading\"\" of long distance telephone lines, allowing to increase the distance and/or the quality of speech. The proof that Meucci came first, can be drawn from the following events, occurred many years after Meucci's discovery (or its notarization):\n",
      "\n",
      "In June-July, 1887, Oliver Heaviside and Alfred Vaschy predicted, on the basis of mathematical calculations, that telephone signals could be transmitted without distortion by increasing the line's self-induction.\n",
      "On 19 June 1900, M. I. Pupin obtained the first two patents for said technique. The Bell Telephone Co. acquired both patents and, later on, applied them in its lines\n",
      "\n",
      "3)Means to counteract the skin effect\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of the increased bandwidth of the telephone with respect to the telegraph, telephone lines were subjected to increased attenuation, due to the so-called skin effect.\n",
      "In two notes of 1862 in his Laboratory notebook (notarized in Lemmi's affidavit of 1885), Meucci suggested to treat the surface of the (copper) conductor in various ways (basically with graphite) to increase its surface conductivity.\n",
      "Moreover, in his caveat of 1871, Meucci stated: “I believe it preferable to have the wire of larger area than that ordinarily employed in the electric telegraph.”\n",
      "Another note in his notebook, dated 17 August 1870, reads: “To be adopted, for having long distance, bundles of copper wire insulated with cotton or any other kind of wrapper; by this means I have obtained a distance of about one mile.” For this \"\"bundle\"\" of copper wires Meucci filed a US patent application \"\"Wire for Electrical Purposes\"\" on 2 July 1880.\n",
      "\n",
      "That Meucci was first in said techniques, is proven by the following facts:\n",
      "\n",
      "Skin effect in telephone lines was neglected by all inventors till 1880, when it began to be investigated by David E. Hughes and Oliver Heaviside.\n",
      "Following their studies and the development of \"\"hard drawn\"\" copper, the Bell Telephone Co. decided to use copper in place of steel, beginning from the Boston-New York line, which was inaugurated on 27 March 1884.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Call signaling\n",
      "\n",
      "Meucci adopted a telegraphic call signaling, simply effected by a Morse key, attached to each end of the line, momentarily short-circuiting the local transmitter. In this way, strong pulses of current were sent along the line, and the distant receiver would emit intermittent ticks, much louder than the ordinary speech. In his caveat of 1871, Meucci gave a detailed description of his call signaling, consistent w\n",

It’s disturbing.\n",
      "\n",
      "If someone read Wikipedia articles related to Yugoslav Wars and base solely on them as a source of research (as many and many students in US and around the world do today), he or she will \"\"learn\"\" that \"\"the \"\"Holy Serbs were victims, the USA/NATO/Albanian/Croats/Muslims ere the villains, and a great injustice was made to the innocent Holy Serb population that never made anything wrong in History but to defend themselves from the aggressors\"\".\n",

The SRS Cabal editors use extreme pressure, group action and extreme edit techniques (and they're not usually caught on Wikipedia anti-edit war barriers, since they act as a collectivity) they are imposing their vision without constraints.

Kurds are a minority in Turkey, just like the Hispanics in USA or Algerians in France. As ludicrous as it would seem to place a Mexicistan or Algeristan on those countries where those minorities are heavily populated in, it is to list a Kurdistan that includes Turkish territory. As long as we don't declare San Diego Mexicistan, which Mexico actually did own at one point and not just have a ripped-up treaty claiming it, it is equally ridiculous to list Kurdistan in Turkey. In Iraq, a country that was set up by the British merging 3 territories, a region called Kurdistan warrants an article, as the Kurds were just placed together with other ethnicities by a colonizing force. But I call BS on Turkey being listed under Kurdistan, as Turkey does not have a region named Kurdistan, and Kurds are Turkish citizens, not living under a Kurdish \"\"state\"\" like in Iraq, whom prints their own passports and such.  \"\n",

All I can state is that the novel has Elphinstone as the rank I stated, but quite possibly that was a literary tweak in order to make Christian the only Master's Mate. I'm certainly not going to claim the fictional variant is correct and all the non-fictional versions are wrong! Now that I look at Elphinstone's and Churchill's ages, Elphinstone (at 36) is 8 years older than Churchill (at 28) so it is unlikely, but by no means impossible, that Elphinstone was junior in rank to Churchill.  To be honest, I'm a bit confused why there would be 2 Master's Mates on the same ship with so small a crew - is that normal?  That would make it the only rank on the Bounty for which there was more than one instance other than quartermaster (and of course, able seaman!).  Anyway, I don't want to get stuck on this issue - I had asked who you the other Master's Mate was and you told me. My response to your reply is now a bit of a digression, but hopefully an informative one. Let's move on. Granted that Elphinstone is indeed a Master's Mate, the number of crew not berthed in the forecastle in point (5) below is now 15 not 14, which is still greater than 13. 66.16.144.18\n",

      "For example, one guy when he comes across the word taoisigh which is the gaelic plural for taoiseach and which is explained as such on its first mention in some articles, frequently changes it to taoiseachs, a non-existent word. He has tried to change governors-general to governor-generals, Prime Minister to Prime minister. He changed links from President of Ireland to President of Ireland, links to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (ie the form of UK between 1901 and 1922) to United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, so linking the reference to the wrong UK. He mucked up some links to Tánaiste (deputy Irish prime minister) by lower-casing it, changed a series of mentions of First Lady when referring to a specific first lady to lowercase first lady, changed one mention of Garret FitzGerald to Garrett Fitzgerald, removed the word Óg from Gearóid Og Fitzgerald and Mór from Gearóid Mór Fitzgerald, not grasping that they actually were two different people (Mór = big in gaelic and indicated the father, Óg meaning small meant his son) and ended up turning an article that mentioned them both into gobbledigook. That is just some of my work he has mucked up. He made a complete mess of some biology articles, reduced an article on mediæval history to such a degree of unreadability that the author, one of the world's top mediæval historians, quick wiki in disgust. I know at least six people who have left wiki over his actions. And there are quite a few such people. Not a lot, but enough to mangle everything they touch. Another contributor constantly changed an elementary fact in 18th century history on the basis of google searches. I checked on google. The majority of articles said he was right. Those google searches turned up stuff that were barely of high school standard. But she treated google as sacrosanct. If a google search said it, it was gospel. \n",

In that case Michael Hardy as he is prone to do, swept in to a topic he knows little about, changed capitalisation, text and even the formula which is the standard DQ formula taught (in that form because as already happened in the discussion on the talk page, if you leave out the parentheses people muck up the order of the calculation and so get the wrong formula). That intervention was classic Michael; go onto a page about a topic he doesn't know much about and instead of asking why it is written like that, unilaterally change it, in most cases producing a version that is so wrong it would be savaged if any student repeated it in a class.\n",

Instead he insisted on applying US capitalisation rules to things whose capitalisation is a result of their existence and usage in parts of the world outside the US. That indeed is one of the reasons why google should never be used in checking capitalisation. Apart from its general unreliability, most website mentions in the US are created by people who automatically and incorrectly apply US capitalisation to things that don't exist in the US and are capitalised internationally. A classic example is the electoral system PR.STV (Proportional Representation using the Single Transferable Vote). Michael insisted on lowercasing it on the basis on a google search. PR.STV isn't used in the US and is generally capitalised when referring to the specific voting system, and lowercased when used generically. Where it is mentioned on google, it is largely on the basis of Americans writing about it and downcasing it to suit American english. So Michael unilaterally mucked up the capitalisation, then another US user moved the page to another name that refers to a somewhat similar but not the same electoral system more widely known in the US.

The Lowlanders were involved in many clan battles and feuds too. The way Scotland was run you needed a clan to hold land and power. Of course some were more violent than others and some Lowland clans were not involved in any violent clan-like activitties at all but they are in the minority.

So this unblock request is, for all intents and purposes, the only way I can inquire about this. There has to be one administrator who is on the level in this place. Why was I blocked, when I had not the right, but rather the duty to remove BLP inaccuracies? Why was I not given a chance to defend myself at the administrator's noticeboard, even though the complaintant never notified me after making the report, as required? Why has  an article, when policy clearly states that is not permissable? I've made a lot of good contributions to this encyclopedia, and I enjoy it. I'm willing to chalk my experience with Spike Wilbur up to one bad apple in the bunch. I realize admins stick together, and I get the fact that no one is willing to go over another administrator's head, and unblock me. The fact is User:Therefore has clearly broken 3RR. I have a hard time believing that any one user could have every single administrator here in his pocket? Spike Wilbur should see that this user has broken the same rule, at the same article. Obviously he's not going to do anything to rectify a situation that he created. I don't care about being unblocked.

Having said that, the expert POV by PressTV does even employ the term \"\"anti-Imperialist\"\" verbatim to describe the Houthis. Russia Today also suggests that the struggle is part of the post-colonialist movements' struggle against imperialists and colonialists. Likewise, the author in the linked paper from Taylor & Francis identifies the same anti-imperialist themes in Hussein al-Houthi's thoughts. Furthermore beyond these sources, the very fact that Houthis' antagonists are well-known to be in alliance with the living reality of US Imperialism and the blatant reality of the ongoing war against Yemen are themselves obvious clues reaffirming the nature of the struggle by the Houthis as being anti-Imperialist in nature. Houthi leaders have also numerously stressed that they are aspiring for independence from foreign influence (namely US and Saudi) as already mentioned in the article.

The article is starting to come together, and I plan to begin working on filling in the {Winners} tables with the 1979-1995 winners.  I'm still not really convinced the page even needs the \"\"Winners\"\" tables, since the ceremony is equally dedicated to awarding television actors (if not more so) and the categories have changed so much over the years it would be impossible to efficiently list all the winners in the various categories that have popped up and disappeared over the years: Dramatic Films, Comedy Films, Action-Adventure Films, and then the \"\"splitting\"\" of categories into age groups, etc. It gets pretty convoluted, so I think it might be a better idea to use the \"\"Winners\"\" section to mention some of the notable former child stars who were nominated for or won a Young Artist Award and then went on to receive  acclaim as adults, but for now I think the tables that are on the page should at least be complete, so I'll be working on that next.  These notes I'm leaving here on the talk page are primarily for the handful of editors who are watching this page, since I know big changes and rewrites can make some watching editors/admins nervous, so I'll be taking this thread down in a week or so after I've finished with the bulk of my work on the page and then probably start a thread to ask other editors if they have an opinion about whether we should keep the \"\"Best Lead/Supporting Actor/Actress in Film\"\" tables. -   \"\n",

This is done using the fewest amount of words possible, and should written so even a child can make snese of it, (at a 6th grade level). We call this the \"\"lede,\"\" and the only purpose of the lede is to answer the question, \"\"What is a liquid?\"\" It should be no more than a paragraph or two.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a subject such as this, an \"\"intro\"\" section would be appropriate. This is just an expanded lede. This may seem a bit redundant, but is actually extremely useful. Some people coming to this article will know absolutely nothing about science, and don't want the feeling of being thrown into a college level class head first. The intro should be written at about a 10th grade level, explaining the scientific aspects in the simplest of terms. (Imagine you're teaching a 10th grade science class. How would you explain it to them?)\n",

      "Then, the following sections should get into college level explanations. It is perfectly acceptable to describe well established theories, and the histories behind those theories, but be careful to make it brief. The article is meant to answer the question of what a liquid is, and should not stray into the History of liquid theory. Also, when giving theory, realize that a scientific theory is really just a very well thought opinion, and should be attributed to its source. Under no circumstances should we combine theories in a way that might lead the reader to a third conclusion, unintended by the original sources. Nor should we give the impression that any theory is somehow absolute truth.\n",

I have seen instances in the past where information was copied and pasted directly from one article to the next. This sort of redundency is usually unnecessary. It's better to add a link to the article where the info is most relevant. And, it is also very distasteful in writing to copy, even from oneself. If it is absolutely necessary to have the same info in multiple articles, then the writing should still be original. The goal is to make articles succinct ... to fulfill the readers curiosity about a subject and only that subject, but to link to any related subject that may further the reader's knowledge. By using this format, it helps satisfy everyone's curiosity before they become bored and move on.\n",

Confidently demonstrating with reliable sources that a statement is an encyclopedic statement appropriate to be on WP is not disruptive editing. However the term disruptive editing is one of a number of terms abused by abusive editors on WP. It is very disheartening when some \"\"trusted\"\" editor immediately use that term against you when you simply have a different opinion. They know the power of that word, that is why they use it. There are a number of these \"\"power\"\" words used in the WP community. Abusively using this tactic is a personal attack - in my opinion. The other editor involved here also stated my contributions in various articles is wasting Wikipedians´ time. He also considers the fact that I address you and other editors by name as something that can be used in a negative way against me.   11:07\"\n",

You will notice that I did quite the opposite of what Cirt wanted at Santorum (neologism).  I am not any way in the habit of backing up Cirt.  It just happens that often he's right, though sometimes he's wrong. And I dislike the sock campaigns that have been been related to the Landmark Education and Church of Scientology articles and turned personal against Cirt.  Talk\n",

On Wikipedia the term is only used to describe distros when the distro itself is called \"\"GNU/Linux\"\" and then only when referring to the distro itself. If you want to change this consensus then the way to go about is not by trying to insert the term GNU/Linux into articles on distributions, such as on Trisquel. You should read Talk:Linux including all the archives of that page, to get the history of the problem as well as Talk:Linux/Name as this is where past consensuses have been formed. You will also want to read GNU/Linux naming controversy and its talk page as background as well. When you have the history of the consensus read then you can present your case at Talk:Linux to try to convince the other editors that all references \"\"Linux\"\" other than to the kernel itself in Wikipedia should be changed to \"\"GNU/Linux\"\".

The basic reasoning is, that it is impossible for avid editors to read pages without editing them, so if you've read the policies and guidelines, that would show up in your contributions.  On guidelines you can generally make minor changes directly to the guidelines themselves.  With policies, unless it is fixing grammar or typos, you pretty much need to post the edits you want to make to the talk page for approval - but that becomes habit after you get used to it.  So my advice is that you start proofreading the P&G;'s, and see where that takes you.  I see David Fuchs has prepared a nomination for you.

      "Dear 206.186.8.130... I have been quite content to leave Dyukov described as a historian Novosti, the state news agency, trots out to dispute Baltic lies about history. (One of several of my edits deleted, each replaced by a more strident defense of Dyukov's credentials.) Given Dyukov's command of basic facts is worse than the factual improprieties he alleges in the film, he already commands far too much space devoted to his views. However, since English-speaking viewersto whom this encyclopedia is targetedget to see Dyukov quite often on \"\"Russia Today\"\" (Novosti's version of CNN or the BBC News), I'm supportive of leaving his commentary in (other editors have mass deleted it). Dyukov's spokesmanship as a historian \"\"specializing\"\" in Soviet history and in debunking, in particular, Baltic \"\"myths\"\" (he uses stronger words in his Novosti interviews) is notable whether I like it or not. However, his POV and role in the official Russian (not independent) media must remain in the article for his presence in the article to be understood and defended.\n",

But it needs to be made sure that it isn't coated with a hidden agenda, which unfortunately seems to persist in these kinds of articles. Let's not forget mainstream academics studying Hunnic history know of only 3 Hunnic words and a few names here and there. The obscurity of Hunnic history makes it hard to come to a conclusion on its ethnic and linguistic origins. Some say they were primarily Turkic, others say Iranian, others Slavic, some even say Uralic, etc. Then to suddenly have an unknown source with a very suspicious title and background making claims about the Turkic form of Hunnic names is rather suspicious. If there can be a proper way to find this gentleman's book without having to go through nationalistic websites, it would perhaps give us a better indication of the man's original message. Sadly these nationalistic websites aren't to be trusted. Some even have a habit of trying to push something that the author in question may not have intended.

The references are in the inlay booklets provided with CD's so don't delete it. Also it clearly states her hit singles career was very much gone by the 1980's after several changes in musical styles, many of which finished off bands that were in when Suzi Quatro was at her peak. It was new wave that finally finished Suzi's recording career, that and motherhood. Also what is this rubbish about her being a major rock star? I could perhaps agree she was in the 1970's but certainly not now! Infact most young people below about 25 have probably never even heard of her. She had her last U.K top 75 hit in 1982 and her last hit in America in 1981 for crying out loud!

      "Without a metatheory, one does not have a truth predicate, which complicates things for realism, because the whole point of that philosophy is that sets really do exist and actually do have the properties ascribed to them. One could argue in favor of a disquotational definition of truth, but that merely pushes the problem around, leading to the same problems as full second-order semantics for arithmetic.   Also, not having a metatheory means that one must treat set theory differently than other branches of mathematics, such as group theory or linear ordering theory. This seems like a difficult distinction to justify. \n",

      "I do think that the \"\"no metatheory\"\" interpretation of ZFC (or Zermelian set theory, if you prefer that) is somewhat common, because it is one way of avoiding the issue that what is called V in the object theory cannot be distinguished from a set in the metatheory. One consequence of my original point is that it would also be coherent to interpret this no-metatheory language merely as a way of making statements from the viewpoint of a person inside a particular model of set theory. Moreover, this interpretation is entirely compatible with the viewpoint that there is an objectively-defined collection consisting of all sets, if no additional meta-level principles such as the ability to force over V are added. However, if one already viewed \"\"all sets\"\" as merely a façon de parler with no objective referent, as I think you are proposing, then it's not clear why one sort of disquotation (\"\"'all sets'\"\" = \"\"all sets\"\") is better than another (\"\"'all sets'\"\" = \"\"all sets in the model at hand\"\"). — Carl ( · talk) \"\n",

For the present he would go on describing his vision, the vision of his predecessor spiritual masters, in articles and books. But as soon as possible he should go to the West.

      "The main impact zone of the crash was approximately 19 metres (57 feet) in width. No wreckage was found from the airliner within this impact zone or inside the building. The lawn immediately in front of the crash site was unmarked. Within the main impact zone was a hole that the object punched in the building, approximately 9 metres (27 feet) in width. The Pentagon is composed of five concentric rings. Only the outer three rings were penetrated. The upper floors of the first ring collapsed, but the structural integrity of the second and third rings remained. At the end of the third ring was a circular 'punch out' hole, again 9 metres (27 feet) in diameter. The wingspan of a Boeing 757 is 38 metres (114 feet). The vast majority of the mass of the aircraft remains unnaccounted for. For flight 77 to have caused the damage observed at the Pentagon, the wings would have had to have been broken off, pushed into the fuselage, after which the fueselage and wings would have had to have been compressed sufficiently to fit through the 9 metre hole. No physical mechanism by which this process could have occurred is known.\n",

A pedophile is just as capable of editing with a neutral POV on a subject matter dealing with pedophilia, as a Jew or a black would be on an issue that involves Jews or blacks. Wikipedia claims to be a online encyclopedia that anyone can edit. If that doesn't include pedophiles, than how is that fair?. If we allow certain sexual minorities to be silenced, what's next?, allowing certain racial minorities to be silenced as well. As a frequent reader and occasional editor of wikipedia, I only want to read factual, neutral POV articles, and I don't care about the race, nationality, ethnicity, sex, or sexual orientation of the editor.

I have kept that promise. First among all earthly things, as a boy and as a man, I have worked for Irish freedom. I have helped to organize, to arm, to train, and to discipline my fellow countrymen to the sole end that, when the time came, they might fight for Irish freedom. The time, as it seemed to me, did come and we went into the fight. I am glad that we did, we seem to have lost, we have not lost. To refuse to fight would have been to lose, to fight is to win, we have kept faith with the past, and handed a tradition to the future… I assume I am speaking to Englishmen who value their own freedom, and who profess to be fighting for the freedom of Belgium and Serbia. Believe that we too love freedom and desire it. To us it is more desirable than anything else in the world. If you strike us down now we shall rise again and renew the fight.

      "I agree that we should be vigilant to ensure that college and university articles don't unduly praise their subjects, particularly since it can quickly get out of hand and become meaningless.  But there really are a handful of institutions for whom their prestige is so well-known and widespread that it has become one of their defining characteristics.  Harvard University is one of those institutions.  It's essential for readers to understand that Harvard University is one of the most prestigious universities in the world.  That's what so many people know about it and why its alumni are disproportionately represented among the political and economic elite.  Indeed, it's why so many colleges, universities, and other institutions proclaim themselves to be the \"\"Harvard of the (region, category, etc.).\"\"\n",

The two additional sources that were added are great and appreciated, but this gets to another point in that those articles reference several schools as the 'most prestigious'. Should those other schools (top 10? top 5?) also get a similarly cited blurb that proclaims them as among the most prestigious in their header. I think that's the fair treatment question that should be raised to ensure consistency. No other school has a similar grandiose opening as Harvard when numerous surveys have shown that there are a select few other Universities that hold comparable prestige.  (\n",

      "1. Regardingn my making a clear distinction between me/us and \"\"your editorial colleagues\"\", yes, you're right. I guess I don't know enough about WikiP yet, but I clearly don't have access to the same \"\"additional facilities\"\" (which I take to mean \"\"tools\"\") as you, so I don't have the same control.\n",
      "Sure, I could put a Copyvio on someone's page, but I rather doubt it would stay there any more than my {db}s did  I assume Copyvio notices are either 1. sent to all admins (or those who deal with Copyvios specifically), and/or 2. posted to the Copyvio page for you and your colleagues to make some sort of determination on. From what you say above, it appears that some Uber Admin(s) makes the final determination.\n",
      "2. Also regarding \"\"tools\"\" I and, I suspect, most WikiP contributors have no power to Lock and page to insure it doesn't get Reverted by anyone else. Nor can we Delete a page, even our own. Nor do we have access, as I assume you do, to EB and other pay services to check for likely infringements.\n",
      "There are even several services used by educational institutions which faculty regularly use to check for plagiarism in term papers, theses, etc. Perhaps you also have access to those? You didn't indicate how that EB page was accessed since the public can only get the \"\"teaser\"\" entry for Crapsey.\n",
      "Thus, to paraphrase your quote and the old axiom: \"\"we are all peers, with equal power to edit, but some of us are more equal than others!\"\"\n",
      "3. Regarding your statement that it's \"\"actually relatively rare for a copyvio to be contested, and most pass without comment,\"\" are you saying that once a Copyvio is pointed out, the \"\"offending contributor\"\" simply concedes the point and allows the page to be removed without so much an objection?!! That's truly astouonding  I'd imagine that most folks do not deliberately borrow from others, however similiar the contents might be.\n",
      "Have no idea what you mean by \"\"the ones that are contested often end up in the sections at the top of the page.\"\" Can you point me to a sample of this?\n",
      "4. Regarding your statement that \"\"he EB page I'm referring to is , the one originally referenced  what do you mean? Referenced by whom? By your colleague?\n",
      "Or are you obliquely saying that WikiP has the means of reading contributor hard drive caches and Recent URL lists to determine where they've been?! I know I didn't reference EB and don't know how you access their pay service, but if you're in fact suggesting that WikiP can somehow monitor member hard drives, I'd find that VERY disturbing...an outright privacy violation. Will run AdAware & Spybot S&D; just to see if anything they regard as \"\"malicious\"\" turns up with WikiP fingerprints on it! ;-) \n",
      "5. On your reply to 3 above that \"\"Wikipedia does not, in general, use text 'with permission,' \"\" I'm confused. The passage I quoted suggests that the authors are granting WikiP a GFDL \"\"license,\"\" which, from my understanding of the law, means \"\"with permission.\"\" The author still \"\"owns\"\" the material and, presumably can make whatever other use s/he wants of it but cannot expect payment from WikiP, restrict the editing of, or, for that matter, even withdraw permission for work submitted to WikiP.\n",
      "6. Regarding your answer to 5 above that you \"\"don't have access to any special posting info. It's all available to everyone, although some of it is better hidden or harder to use,\"\" this sort of relates to my #1 immediately above, and I guess I'm confused again. How in the world would Admins and other \"\"watchers\"\" like you (still don't know what your title is) know \"\"what's new\"\" on WikiP if you don't get notices or have some list you can comb through? Are you saying there's an actual public list of all new articles? If so, where is it, and what prompts you folks to check one article vs. another?\n",

      "\n",
      " NATIVE INHABITANTS \n",
      "\n",
      "The history of Kemah, Texas goes back more than 180 years. The Karankawa Indians, a group of five nomadic, linguistically related groups including the Cocos, Cujanes, Karankawas proper, Coapites, and Copanos, occupied the area from Galveston Bay to Corpus Christi Bay during the late Spring and Summer months. Evidence of the Karankawas near present-day Kemah was discovered back in the 1890s. This discovery will be discussed later in the article. Indian inhabitants began to leave when European settlers arrived, and most had retreated from the area by 1850.\n",
      "\n",
      " THE DISAPPEARING FOUNDER \n",
      "\n",
      "The recorded history of Kemah began in the early 1800s, when Texas was still under the Mexican flag. On August 24, 1824, the Mexican government granted a labor (approx. 177 acres) of land to to a settler by the name of Michael Gouldrich. Gouldrich was listed as one of Stephen F. Austin’s first colonists in 1826, a widower over 50 years of age engaged in farming and stockraising. His land was located on the south bank of Clear Creek, where the creek flows into Galveston Bay. Oddly enough, Gouldrich disappeared from historical record after his recorded receipt of the land grant. No historical records or accounts identify him with any development of a settlement, homestead, or right of way at his claim location. Odder still, there is no record of his death. \n",
      "\n",
      " \"\"FLANDERS GROVE\"\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Sometime between 1826 and 1830, a man by the name of William Vince of Vince’s Bayou, Harrisburg County, acquired the Clear Creek land. On several early maps of Galveston Bay dating back to that time period, the name “Flanders Grove” or “Flanders Labor” appears in the vicinity of the present day town of Kemah, at the mouth of Clear Lake. The place-name has ties to a New Hampshire native by the name of John Flanders. John was the son of Levi and Mary (Sargent) Flanders and was born in Salisbury, Massachusetts. John had been in business with his father in New Hampshire. No record exists concerning the nature of business John and his father owned, although apparently at least a part of the business they conducted dealt in real estate. In the time immediately prior to John's move to the Texas territory, he and his father had a disagreement over a mortgage held by John on a piece of property owned by a widow. John wished to foreclose and his father opposed it. The disagreement developed into bad feelings and John left home, never communicating with his family thereafter.\n",
      "\n",
      "John Flanders was issued a passport for six months on December 7, 1830, in Austin’s colony. A notation in Austin’s Register of Families reads, “Flanders is to be included as a colonist although he takes no land.” Flanders, a 32-year-old  single farmer at the time, had arrived in the Galveston Bay region in mid to late December 1930. It is believed that his first place of residence was in Anahuac, Texas, on the northern tip of Galveston Bay. There, he acquired a house and a lot. However, he was not listed on the 1834 census of Anahuac and it is believed that somtime between early 1931 and the time of the 1934 census Flanders made the purchase of William Vince's land. Since the 1934 censuse does not record Flanders' name as a resident of Anahuac, it is reasonable to assume that he was probably living on his Clear Creek property by that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sadly enough, John Flanders was listed among the dead at the Alamo. He was one of thirty-two men, commanded by Captain George Kimball, who entered the Alamo on March 1, from Gonzales. Why he was with the men from Gonzales is unknown. Flanders was a Private under Kimball, 36 years old at the time of the Alamo seige, and still unmarried.\n",
      "\n",
      " THE MYSTERY HEIRS \n",
      "\n",
      "With John Flander's death came some interesting and mysterious dealings concerning his estate that, of course, included the \"\"Flanders Grove\"\"/\"\"Flanders Labor\"\" tract. In 1841, Allen Vince, brother of the now-deceased William Vince and resident of Vince’s Bayou, Harris County, was named administrator of the John Flanders estate. The estate was said to consist of only the labor of land at the mouth of Clear Creek on the Southwest side. A petition for sale of the land, to satisfy debts, was requested May 28, 1844. The deceased Vince owed money for lawyer fees (in the case of Sawyer vs Vince in District Court). The land was appraised at $2.00 per acre and sold to Jonathan D. Waters on July 2, 1844 for $354.00. This transaction leaves open the questions of whether or not Flanders still owed William Vince any monies for the land purchase, and how much legal right Allen Vince had to sell the land and use the revenues to pay of a debt on behalf of his brother's estate, instead of keeping the Flanders estate intact.\n",

      "hallo Moondyne, I do admit that when I signed onto Wikipedia I was not aware that it was a concensus community of knowledge Nazis but now that I am aware of it I will make the appropriate adjustments. I was under the obviously mistaken impression that Wikipedia was a venue for sharing facts, knowledge and information. The notion that the Stradbroke Galleon story is a pet theory of mine is total rubbish as it has been written about, discussed and investigated for more than 100 years by historians and historical groups such as the Royal Historical Society of Queensland, the Maritime Archaeology Association of Queensland and many more too numerous to include here. There exists, in various libraries, books and communities a large body of written and oral history concerning the galleon story which I have attempted to fairly and accurately place in the WP domain. The fact that a story is not accepted by \"\"mainstream\"\" academics is not a valid reason for deletion of either of my contributions. What has occured here is a classic example of manipulation of an information resource by a vested interest group (i.e. Hesperian and his friends) who are representatives of the \"\"mainstream\"\" view. Hesperian complain about the media coverage I have recieved but this never appeared in any of the WP contributions I made and Hesperian's mention of the media coverage demonstrates the core reason for Hesperian's antagonistic attitude, simple, old fashioned professional jealousy. Thus valid historical data is being deliberately surpressed by Hesperian for personal reasons. For example the Portuguese walking stick handle which was found in an Aboriginal midden, identified by a Spanish Musuem offical and story told to me by a UQ Archaeology PhD student is very relevant to the theory of the Portuguese discovery of Australia. This kind of knowledge suppression is not what Wiki is about but I guess you do not care as you appear to be part of the happy little click or have been sucked in by Hesperian and his little band of mates, which is a pity, but history is full of the suppression of information by vested interest groups so why should I expect Wiki be any different. Still it is dissapointing. Happy trails. Gregjay (talk) \n",

This view treats ITIS as a reference point, and nothing more.  If a person B's particular scheme differs from ITIS in a defined way it is 1 generation removed from ITIS.  A similar situation applies if C's scheme differs in defined way from ITIS.  However, if C defines his scheme with reference to B's then he is 2 generations removed from the reference point.

      "Beckett’s writings aren’t just about the journey. If they were, “deeply pessimistic” would be nearly undebatable. They’re just as much about the destination, or at least the goal. And while he frames life’s journey as a slog through shit, his ultimate implication is that the slog is worthwhile. As everything from the Greek and Latin classics to the greatest of Hollywood’s pro-war propaganda movies have proven again and again, the more monstrously you portray the obstacle, the larger looms the hero who overcomes them. The same is true in Beckett: the obstacles are unrelenting and nearly insurmountable, but the journey continues, heroically. The Beckett hero may be standing in the dark, but he's faced towards the light, distant—an unattainable—as it may be.\n",

If anybody ends up getting charged, it may well be David Igelasis for failure to do his duty as a sworn U.S. Attorney for political gain.  There are no 'alleged illegal activities' for Karl Rove because there is no charging document as in, \"\"Karl Rove is here charged with violating federal statute XX.22.XYZ.\"\"  Therefore, as I asserted way back in the summer, you cannot say, \"\"To date, no charges have been filed against Rove for his alleged illegal activities,\"\" since there are no alleged illegal activities.  No one in the federal prosecutors office is claiming Karl Rove has done anything illegal.  They were just angry that he defied coming in to answer questions which is his legal right to do.  He wasn't being charged with anything, therefore he did not have to speak with anybody. Then the prosecutor told the judge she was looking into possible criminal activity.  That changes the rules and now she is allowed to compel anybody in the Bush administration to come to answer questions.  Which she did and Rove showed up on time and answered every question.  Therefore, removing the weasel phrase that includes, \"\"so far no criminal charges have been filed against his alleged illegal activities,\"\" is correct.  You cannot say he has 'alleged illegal activities' unless he's been formally charged with a crime.  The investigation will die a quiet death because it was politically motivated to begin with and the prosecutor has figured out by now that she won't be getting a seven figure book deal or promoted to AG. \n",

This is not a question of making a mistake in believing WordBomb. This is a question of believing WordBomb, and then, instead of reporting it privately to the ArbCom, or asking SlimVirgin privately for an explanation, engaging in extremely inappropriate, hasty, behaviour, even crowing over the person he was accusing of sockpuppetry, and showing most clearly that he had a grudge against her. Additionally, in another case which is being heard at the moment, a user who had originally registered with his real name requested a name change, and repeatedly asked people not to keep referring to him by his old name, and Cyde responded by provocatively posting a link to the user rename log.

I don't care which Dayewalker actually is. Whichever they wish to have used here is fine. Until then, and basing my guess on the name alone, and ascribing no gender traits to any of Dayewalker's words or actions, I have referred to Dayewalker as a she. If that is not the correct gender, just cut the rhetoric and say that Dayewalker should be referred to with a male pronoun. If Carol O'Conner could live with his name and constant gender misidentification, one hopes that an adult with the name Dayewalker should realize people are going to offer up their best guess at what gender pronoun to use.\n",

Maybe Dayewalker is \"\"Daye Walker.\"\" Makes sense. I can't know for sure, but it appears that \"\"Daye Walker\"\" is a woman as Daye Walker puts another name that would appear to be a maiden family name in parenthesis. However, in a modern age, that may not be what she is indicating by this choice of presenting her name, nor is that taking of one's spouse's family name upon marriage universal to either gender, But why guess when someone could simply state the fact?

I said it shouldn’t because Daly was only one of four sponsors of the initiative, and the initiative wasn’t especially controversial in SF (it won with 58% of the vote). However, because the initiative was controversial in the eyes of many pro-gun groups, it made national headlines with Daly’s name featured in newspaper articles, etc., BillyTFried thought Proposition H should be included in the Chris Daly article.YouTube video: Yesterday night, BillyTFried posted some words on my Talk page along with a link to a YouTube video of himself firing what looks like a semi-automatic weapon. (In case the video gets taken down, it is 1:43 minutes long and shows BillyTFried firing weapons at a shooting range while thrash music plays. BillyTFried occasionally leers at the camera. The video is titled “Shoot Em' Up!”.)\n",

Denzel Washington had already gotten paid his upfront guarantee pay-or-play, so he signed on just for his gross. (He also got paid half his $20-million fee on Inside Man.) This way even when American Gangster makes money, so do gross participants Washington, Scott, Grazer and Russell Crowe. That adds up to a huge piece of the final gross going out the doorin all likelihood, some 37.5 25% of the gross. ($37.5 was Universal's all-time high, on Grinch.)

The reason I believe this is that I have been the unpaid Park Ranger working the barrier and taking the abuse of the general public during prior shutdowns. Now, most of these people are frustrated and confused. They don't understand that it is not a decision the ranger at the barrier made, which is keeping them from entering, but a decision made by the leaders of the nation. When one of the leaders of the nation who caused the incident berates a person making barely above minimum wage, basically at one of the lowest levels of authority over that opening or closing decision, OVER AN INCIDENT HE HIMSELF CREATED that is an unprecedented level of hypocrisy and posturing for the cameras. He thought he'd look like a defender of the veterans, and fool people who couldn't reason well enough to realize he caused the very situation. He told that woman that SHE should be ashamed for doing her job as he and his fellow politicians directed. How dare he tell her to be ashamed for his actions? His cognitive dissonance level must be off the chart. It tells voters something EXTREMELY IMPORTANT about a person when he seeks office in the future.
