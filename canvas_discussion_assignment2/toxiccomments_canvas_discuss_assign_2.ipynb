I think I did try to allude to WP:PRIMARY in the FAC, but all too indirectly – for example when I wrote: \"\"As regards using these sources for historical analysis, I'm quite sure I've not done this, instead just stating what's there, comparable I'd have thought to reading a map?\"\" I was aware of WP:PRIMARY, but honestly felt shy of pushing it too hard, for many reasons, one of which was that I was genuinely surprised when the idea of OR was introduced: I had felt sure of my ground but was made to doubt, and, given what you say, perhaps wrongly assumed that everyone commenting there understood WP:PRIMARY better than I. I was also surprised the FAC was archived when it was, and I'm sorry you didn't get a chance to get involved in that discussion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your view of \"\"note 133\"\" is quite correct: of course I might say that, but I have direct, personal knowledge of the documents concerned, and have doubted the wisdom of saying so. I felt that explaining that in the FAC might seem arrogant and might anyway make no difference. It would certainly have compromised the degree of anonymity that my user name allows. But my argument that the E 179 database can be regarded as a secondary source is precisely because it's the product of several years' work by professional historians, who were paid by Cambridge University and provided with computing and practical support by the Public Record Office: what the database says is the result of extremely time-consuming historical analysis, and not merely the work of data-inputters. I felt that I did make the argument you suggest about allowable use of primary sources, as well as the argument about secondary, but that those with opposing views simply weren't buying it. Perhaps I should have been more insistent, but even now I'm not sure how I might have done that without angering people who after all are volunteers. Anyway, you're quite right that an FAC isn't the best place to explore a point of principle – nor is your talk page, apologies for going on a bit there! But again I think perhaps I was too shy: it did occur to me to get an uninvolved opinion, but wasn't sure how and was afraid I might be accused of forum-shopping.

I think I shall test the issue of the primary sources first, wherever you might suggest, and then, if need be, consider adapting the article to make it redundant. I haven't forgotten that you also previously suggested getting something in print: I'm pretty confident that can be done, but it still hasn't risen to the top of my to-do list. That may change...!

Therefore if one insists on deleting this particular article then go ahead as it seems to me there is no room for democratic thinking on your website whatsoever. I’d like to add a few more words as my final statement. Wikipedia says:  “Sources may encompass published works in all forms and media, and in any language. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability. The art works and art life of the artist is the sourcefor academic press, Ukrainian media, academic institutions, as well as poets, writers and publications use his paintings & drawings to illustrate books. The artist takes a part in a busy art life in the Ukraine presenting a number of exhibitions & art projects. Having said that I see that there is no enough evidence for one????? \n",

What is the difference between the article about Alexander Voytovych and, for example, the Herb Roe’s article, why the mentioned article is considered more accurate? I must highlight once again that instead of explaining what has to be changed or corrected on the page, one awards us with thenoticeboards. Regarding self-promotion  which was mentioned a few times I’d like to make it clear  the artists is a Ukrainian and naturally all sources are Ukrainian, and if the mentioned language is unknown to one it doesn’t meant that it allows one doubts the genuine sources.

There is no other reference to the team on the internet regarding its history and after increasing support and interest, I believe it merits a wikipedia page. I believe the support should be aware about the clubs history and current situation. Also, as the only football team from the relatively big East Craigs area, I believe that is also a reason to have it on Wikipedia.

First of all, though I hate to flash credentials, let me point out that I am not some urban partisan of one city or another: I am a graduate student in urban studies, and my goal both on Wikipedia and in my academic career is to understand and describe urban processes.  I agree with you in as much as most articles on cities on Wikipedia are exaggeratedly positive: alas, but boosters have their way on these topics.  Most major city articles could use to be more critical.  The Detroit one is simply one glaring example of the difference between real life and its presentation here.\n",

      "You contradict yourself multiple times in your response (and, for the love of god, stop tinkering with it!  It distorts the appearance of our conversation).  How can you claim that New York City is \"\"five cities\"\" (only two of the boroughs were incorporated as cities before joining into a single city in 1898; today, they are tightly bound by transit and employment patterns) and yet demand that the unfocused, sprawling Detroit metropolitan area be considered one city?  How can you stick to an arbitrary statistic about the wealth of Oakland county, and yet deny the significance of the fact that most statistics (even those that address metropolitan areas and not just urban municipalities) place Detroit near the top of the list of the most dangerous? \n",
      "\n",
      "The point that this article needs to make is obviously not that the Detroit metropolitan area is poor or that it is deteriorated; both of those statements are obviously false.  Rather, it needs to make it abundantly clear that the metropolitan area contains inside of it a vast segment of abandonment and crime that continues to be in decline for over five decades.  The existence of upper middle class suburbs of relative wealth and low crime do nothing to make the deterioration of the urban core less notable; neither does the recent redevelopment of a piece of that core.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I must point out your focus on New York City is rather misguded  its deterioration and crime are now of a historical character; if Wikipedia had existed twenty years ago, one can only hope that it would have focused on NYC's urban wasteland character more.  In response to your other points, I would like to invite you to join me in patrolling the self-promotion of all city articles on Wikipedia.  You are certainly right, many of them do deserve to be less positive.  Let's start with this one.  \n",

      "I'm highly amazed by the fact that this debate rages on. If I may interject, Aleta formed a subsection entitled Arbitrary Page Break. Note using the word Arbitrary over say, Random? Are we going to throw a huge fuss over the inclusion of a more sophisticated word? Sobriquet is quite clearly at least somewhat different from Nickname, otherwise there would be only one article encompassing both words. My suggestion is per a growing trend on Wikipedia: Link sobriquet to a definition in Wiktionary, should one exist. This saves readers the hassle of going through an entire article trying to summarily grasp the full definition of one word within an article comprised of several thousand such words. Furthermore, if Wikipedia is meant to be an informal learning tool of sorts, why fear incorporating a higher grade-level vocabulary into it as a means of providing the best possible learning experience? And if we have to \"\"dumb down\"\" a word here, the same precedent would theoretically have to be set for the entire English Wikipedia, thereby degrading the quality of articles. As someone pointed out, if readers cannot grasp the lingusitics of the standard English wikipedia, there's Simple English to cater to that need. So, that's my offer for a solution. Dictionaries are as important of a resource as an encyclopedia and complement one another: Get the information you want and if you don't know what a word means, just look it up.\n",

      "If the Manx are identified as a separate ethnic group, then why aren't the Channel Islanders?  You want so much to believe that the Normans aren't related to the English that you omit them from the related groups section, but keep the Bretons who aren't even part of the British Isles.  In fact; archaeology confirms that the Bretons left Britain as Salian Franks were among the Nordic invaders when Rome fell.  TharkunColl says that the Normans aren't related, but you say that the Channel Islanders do not constitute a separate ethnic group.  Where is the consistency of logic in those assumptions, which defies consensus outside of your joint control of this article?  Things are much different in the wide world of academia and scholasticism.  Well, Channel Islanders speak a language closer to English than any Celtic tongue.  Why is that a bad thing; why does negative POV have to be accepted?  Now, who is fantasising about the Dark Ages again?  Why would the Normans of the Channel be excluded, when they are HM the Queen's loyal subjects?  Remember what they endured for us during WWII, which the Celtic nations did not have so bad...  When has Brittany declared their loyalty these past 500 years?\n",
      "\n",
      "At least insular Normandy is still with us and this is a fact that TharkunColl especially hates beyond all doubt, since it means that England still has a major toehold of continual ethnic relations with France (while Hanover has come and gone).  He is upset because he views the French relationship to be unfair to England, but has no qualms about that in relation to English \"\"oppressive influence\"\" on Celtic speakers with special help by German princes.  The same POV TharkunColl uses to exclude the French is that which the Irish use to exclude the English.  The question is, why would you do something to others if you do not want it done to yourself?  (TharkunColl claims that he is not bound by the Golden Rule, since he is not Christian) The solution is for English and Irish nationalists to not act this way at the Wikipedia.  Wikipedia is not a vehicle for these types of POV; these Balkanist notions.  When discussing ethnic relatives, the Channel Islanders are a mutual bridge between the English and French.  This is confirmed by all academics and scholars; that you two fringe-theorists disagree is of no consequence to the world at large.  On this page, there are several objections to your dual consensus, but TharkunColl calls them fantasy.  Why don't we all gang up on you Francophobes together?\n",

He supports the errant belief that Hanover is where the English come from as opposed to where Denmark's old sphere of influence was and before the Holy Roman Empire and/or Kingdom of Germany existed.  German princes have no roots in England at allthey have only been recent and foreign: Habsburg, Orange-Nassau, Oldenburg (now Mountbatten), Hanover and Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (now Windsor).  When George changed to Windsor, it did not conceal the true nature of the monarchyneither did the Bombing of Dresden in Saxony have that effect of integrating these Germans.  The more they try so hard to be accepted, the further our people have rejected their status as our Sovereigns.  There have never been so culturally and socially unpopular royalty in the history of the British Isles, yet for some political reasons...others feel it is necessary to make a stalemate by using a straw man fallacy against the Anglo-French fusion which has been witnessed in posterity; by noting that the Germans are an unpopular choice for inclusionall the while saying that Hanover is where the English people are from.\n",

What we currently have on project is a kind of pre-tribal band system, which can look like any other system (because the elements of all sophisticated political systems are present 'in the bud' in social bands). There are some elements of tribal society developing (Arbcom and administrators fill a role 'tribal elders' in loose tribal aggregates, policy and guidelines take on an almost mystical/devotional role in some discussions), but on individual pages it still largely devolves to conflicts between small ideologically insular groups fighting for control of a resource.

These features are noticeably absent from many of the more contentious discussions on project.  If we are not willing to take the steps to achieve a properly functioning consensus system, then we would really do better to try for another less-open approach, because dysfunctional consensus systems are ugly, ugly, ugly beasts.

I would go a different way: The famous musicians (or their fans) who accused him should show their sources (they have the advantage of being alive and are able to defend themselves against accusations). It would make more sence to me to write about the obvious racism of Chuck D and Mary Blidge and a lot of other famous people than about Elvis' non-exixting racism. I think it's is unfair to the music and cultural impact of Elvis that such things got too much space in the article and other much more essential aspects of Elvis did not get mentioned. I think people who are interested in the person and music of Mary Blidge or Chuck D should discuss it on the discussion site of their articles in wikipedia. They should find out if there is racism or not. Or maybe start an article \"\"racism in showbussiness\"\" and dicuss it there. I think you should not let  it become your problem that some people (for instance Chuck D and Blidge obviously) have problems with 1.Elvis being white , 2.the fact that he was from the rural south, 3.that they believe what other people say only because they share a similar pigmentation and repeat it without checking out any sources or 4.that they wanted get simply attention. By the way - Do you think this musicians ever heard one of  A. Crudup's or Kokomo Arnold's songs or even Roy Brown? I think you could write that Elvis was target of racism and accused of being a racist and mentioning some source and footnotes. But for an article about Elvis it is too detailed the way it is.

He meant much more to them than the other way around (positive or negative). I only gave details about the meeting I've read in a german book which proably was not published in english language. It shows a very negative behavior of Elvis and I wished he would have act different but the sources are that way and having the Beatles Anthology on dvd I could see and hear  Ringo Starr telling the story (only McCartney was very, very kind, maybe even a little bit white washing).\n",

Wikipedia's rules are suspended there, including keeping a history, open editing, etc.  Therefore, if you announce first on IRC, you have, effectively, not announced at all.  I've tried to avoid taking such a draconian line, but that is the actual line.  In the meantime, knowing that people will say things as soon as they notice them, and, if they're on IRC at the time, they'll say it first there, the biggest thing is that every IRC user needs to know that whatever is said there simply hasn't been said at all, as far as Wikipedia is concerned.\n",

It can take hours for me to review fully - especially where close paraphrasing is the issue instead of copy-pasting. (Copy-pasting - so much easier!)  I jumped heavily through his history and didn't find a lot of problematic content that seems to cross the line into copyright issues. What I did find seems to be gone. Mind you, this is a judgment call and I'm not 100% sure I'm suggesting the right one. Without actually DOING the CCI, I can't be sure I'm not missing something major.  (talk) \"\n",

This is not an \"\"alternate persona\"\", this is me talking the way I talk, trying to resolve an issue with another user the way I would do normally, a user I have no prior conflict with or any intention of alarming or harassing. In this case however, for sound common sense reasons that you two would do well not to feign ignorance of given neither of you are new admins, I just don't happen to want to make my other contributions available to all and sundry just because I happened to have decided to try and do that. ErrantX, if you want to continue to smear my actions in the most despicable way, by trying to paint what were civil, polite queries, as a \"\"pursuit\"\", and you want to continue to insult me by insinuating I'm a coward, then I guess there's nothing I can do stop you given you've been entrusted with the power to do so. But I'll take the fact that neither of you are prepared to detail what part of WP:SOCK I have actually violated, or indeed identify which part of WP:HARASS I am supposedly guilty of, as evidence that you can't. Not to mention neither of you seem prepared to present any evidence that Malleus himself felt threatened or alarmed by the conversation, or had asked me to leave and I had refused to do so. I guess you two can live with that I suppose, but mark my words, if or when there's an arbitration case concerning Malleus' conduct, then I'll be entering this experience into evidence, and adding User:ErrantX and User:Bwilkins as admin parties to it, with questions to answer as to why they chose to block off an attempt at civil discourse with the user, who neither requested the communication to stop, or said he felt threatened or harassed by it in any way. I did have half a mind to try and continue the conversation here if Malleus was willing, given that there's some simple concluding statements that arise from it that I'd have liked to have seen whether he was happy to sign off on or not, but I get the sense that you two would probably block talk page access for some spurious reason, whether he was interested in doing so or not. I sincerely hope there's nothing deeper than simple admin over-reaching going on here, but precedent says otherwise with these types of disputes. I'm sadly reminded by your actions of several other cases which ended up at arbitration simply because people were unwilling to follow some basic steps like AGF, indeed the steps outlined in policy. So, you just content yourselves that you've done something good here, and I'll just get back to my main account and do my thing there, and we'll see what the future holds for all of us.

      "Ok, Spitsbergen was the island and the archipelago's name for a long while. Then it was the Spitsbergen archipelago, and the main island became West Spitsbergen to distinguish it from the archipelago. The German spelling Spitzbergen was never a variant, just a mistake (I've said a thousand times) by authors who didn't or don't know any Dutch and/or know/knew little to nothing about the island's history. Greenland, Groenland, etc. were names that should only be referenced in a historical context, as they were also based on a misconception, and need not be mentioned in the lead. West Spitsbergen, as it was once known, should be mentioned in the lead, like any other standard name (not a \"\"variant\"\", or a mistake like Spitzbergen/Greenland/Groenland). Again, every other single article on wiki has the former standard name of a place/region just after its present standard name. Again, do not revert.   19:03\"\n",

      "Mmmm, this is a tricky issue. The debate as I see it is between providing a useful article for readers desiring information not otherwise contained in Wikipedia, and providing something basically inaccurate. For example, Brooklyn Beckham (the son of footballer David Beckham) was deemed not notable enough to merit his own Wikipedia article. Hence the link from Brooklyn Beckham redirects to the \"\"Personal life\"\" section of his dad's article. Not strictly accurate, but probably the most useful link for people who want to know about Brooklyn. In the absence of an article about Gadara (Umm Qais), if there was no other article related to Gadara, the same might apply to the redirect to Legion (demon). The alternative would be to create a stub article which basically has just one or two lines of text, including a link tothe Legion (demon). This would give people the option of expanding it later on if they so desired. thanks  —   \"\n",

First, the relevant article was only published 4 days ago, and so it is too recent for the rest of the academic community to have chewed it over and responded in any way. The articles in Wikipedia are not random newsfeeds of the latest events in each topic, but are encyclopedic summaries based mainly on secondary sources, that give a balanced overview of their subject. Primary research sources published in the last few days rarely make an article, and should never be used at the end of a section implying that they may represent the 'last word' on a subtopic. Secondly, the abstract of the referenced paper actually says that, by setting experimental subjects \"\"“science comprehension” tests\"\", that it has detected \"\"the contamination of the science-communication environment with forms of cultural status competition\"\". This is a long way from the much more even-handed coverage that Vgy7ujm gave it, by saying \"\"that global warming skeptics are as familiar with the relevant science as their opponents. They simply arrive at different conclusions.\"\" - as if this gives their antiscience views equal validity.

Second, even if there was a way to keep Glc inside the cell, say through active transport, Glc poses a danger to the cell integrity as Glc is a highly osmotically active compound. The cell solves these two issues with a single solution by synthesizing glycogen from Glc - the enormous glycogen molecules can't leave the cell, and by having osmotically inert glycogen instead of Glc, the cell avoids the osmotic shock.  13:55, 30\n",

      "I wasn't questioning the \"\"literary forgery\"\" issue i.e. \"\"hoax\"\" but the claim that \"\"plagiarism\"\" isn't used here in the lead except as a partisan view when looking at the sources of the document. Given that the document was published well after the death of the source author (whom it is alleged borrowed from an earlier source anyway) your example isn't remotely relevant. The chain of authorship isn't as simplistic as your example. An alternative presentation of plagiarism is the Origin_of_the_Book_of_Mormon#Purported_plagiarism because of the intent of the author but oddly enough the Book_of_Mormon article doesn't mention \"\"plagiarism\"\" at all. Here it is the reverse with numerous use of wording for \"\"plagiarism\"\" and in the lead paragraphs but yet with no clear idea how the (mostly) anonymous authors would gain from the plagiarism i.e. gain from the reputation of Maurice Joly. The claim of \"\"plagiarism\"\" only works if there is an unearned increment to the plagiarizing author's reputation that is achieved through false claims of authorship. Now the problem for you is that Serge Nilus did plagiarise the protocols but the protocols themselves are not plagiarised but derivative. If no one claims authorship then where does that leave the claim of plagiarism ? . That's not clearly proven here so I'm suggesting that the word \"\"plagiarism\"\" is removed from the lead paragraph (though it can stay within the main text and elsewhere that the protocols are used in context of being derivative from the earlier work) as it unbalances the lead. \"\"hoax\"\" and \"\"literary forgery\"\" can obviously stay.   \"\n",

If we simply used the \"\"Black\"\" figure from the census we'd be ignoring the large number of people who have mixed African and European/Native American ancestry. We can't use the \"\"Brown\"\" figure either, as this would include many people who have both European and Native American ancestry but no African ancestry. So the census figures are no good for us and we need to find a different source that estimates African ancestry directly without using the \"\"black\"\"/\"\"brown\"\" colour labels. The 20-30% estimation comes from an official document from the Venezuelan government (the Embassy in the US) which specifically states this as the number of people with African ancestry, so is a reliable source for our purposes. If you have an equal or better reliable source that gives an alternative figure then please let me know what it is. \n",
      "The 100% issue is a red herring - \"\"mestizo\"\" and \"\"African ancestry\"\" are overlapping categories and can't be added together as if they were distinct... \"\"mestizo\"\" in Venezuela means a mixture of European, Native American and/or African ancestry, so some of the people included in \"\"mestizo\"\" are also included in \"\"African ancestry\"\" and you'd be counting them twice if you added the two together. A better check is that we'd expect \"\"Afican ancestry\"\" to be all of the \"\"Black\"\" category plus part of the \"\"Brown\"\" category, so more than 3% and less than 53% - the 20-30% estimate fits this perfectly.\n",

Administrators, yourself included, do not, and cannot, play any role whatever within the Wikipedia scheme other than that of assuring that WP guidelines are implemented and not infringed by the users: there is no scope within the project, as it stands defined at present, for any other additional role that they might even potentially or hypothetically assume.  Even their efforts at protecting the site from vandalism, etc., are only within their purview as guardians of (published) house rules (which, in this case, define vandalism for example in ways differing from those understood by the general public) — nothing, nothing, not an iota more than that.  There is no mechanism here for ‘discretion’, ‘broad’ or otherwise, whereby they could obtain blanket license to violate those guidelines without accountability: the moment that such powers (to dispense with guidelines altogether) are vested in or arrogated by them, (1) they cease to be administrators and become ma-and-pa corner grocery’s owners, with the goods on the shelves their private property to dispose of as they see fit; and (2) Wikipedia ceases to be a community editing project and becomes the private fiefdom of a limited few.

You may say to me, ‘you have claimed xxx, which conflicts with stated policy xxx, and fails to take into consideration the fact that xxx, published here xxx’.  The right to make generalized unsubstantiated allegations amounts to the license to launch personal attacks, a practice that again runs afoul of Wikipedia policies.  You are now violating those policies yourself.

There is no other remedy, as failure to clean the house would amount to allowing it to sink to the lowest common denominator determined by such administrators (and their unaccounted and perhaps unaccountable private reasons which propel them to certain actions).  Enthusiasm for the project and other such factors cannot be sufficient qualification to make someone an administrator here: a certain integrity, a sense of ethics, and a modicum of objectivity (the ability, that is, to see beyond the tip of one’s nose), are also required.  While the fulfilment of these requirements cannot obviously be easily determined beforehand, the discharge of one’s mission as an administrator can be appraised retroactively, and such appraisal should determine whether a user should continue in his/her supervisory capacity.

Also the logic you present above is simply not correct at all.  The fact that human physiology is a product of biological evolution does not mean that the origin of religion can be explained through evolutionary mechanisms or as a product of biological evolution.  Perhaps without the evolution of certain cognitive capacities human practices like religion would not be possible, but the origin of religion itself may be entirely \"\"social\"\" or \"\"cultural\"\" given a certain state of cognitive evolution.  If that were the case then theories of religion's origin would not be evolutionary theories at all, yet they would be equally \"\"scientific\"\" and clearly non-religious in nature.

This is why we are not making progress, because we do not have any editors who are willing to dedicate the time and effort to work on this this. Consequently you are taking advantage of this lack of editors and you are using an old AFD as your leverage, because you can run to any admin, who only know the rules and know little about content. This is unfair and unacademic and is very political. Dbachmann knows very well that the articles I created are valid. He has admitted that he agrees in principal with the ideas I have presented, but simply disagrees with me because he dislikes my demeanor User_talk:Dbachmann#origin_of_religion. I had worked on the article \"\"Origin of language\"\" using the same approach. Before I started working on the origin of language, the topic was approached from a psychological or sociological perspective filled with archaic fringe and opinionated theories. I proceeded to add the evolutionary perspective to the article, after which Dbachmann reviewed the article with some refactoring he upgraded the article to B-class. I used the same approach on the origin of religion only to be met with some of the worst hostility to knowledge. As I often mention, you had even disputed the out of Africa hypothesis, or that grave goods are considered evidence of a belief in the afterlife . Here you are seen to be making up your own theories. So I do feel justified to doubt the credibility of some of your assertions and also some of the other editors. I have always asked admins and a lot of other editors to assist in dispute resolution, but many seem content with pushing buttons and chasing after vandals and boosting their egos by blocking people, they have no interest in content. So I propose to go for dispute resolution, if you think you have a case, you should opt for it. If you are afraid and want to continue using the archaic AFD as your silver bullet, then this dispute will needlessly continue. Of course the result will be blocks of which I am the top candidate, but what a waste that would be. Who would be there to provide education on grave goods.   \n",

People can sometimes retain purely oral folk-memories of things that happened thousands of years ago, but such memories tend to be heavily-genericized and assimilated to common motifs or archetypes.  Considering that Germanic folk-memory transformed Attila the Hun from an oppressive and sinister foreign conqueror to a noble king (Atli/Etzel) in less than a thousand years, I doubt that there's much possibility for accurate or specific folk-memories of Neanderthals over more than 20,000 years...\n",

Although I too have some concerns with this account which primarily are the lack of this editor's responsiveness to numerous warnings of copyright concerns (as Hammersoft had pointed out), and editor's lack of engagement in dialogue regarding these issues. This could be simple misunderstanding of the copyright policy for the editor's user space, but the repeated violations are disconcerting. In fact, I can't be entirely sure that the user account is only one person (a kind of reverse sockpuppetry that makes me uneasy). However, it is my understanding that editors are not in WP:COI solely due to their place of employment or username, but rather because of the issues of POV, reliability and neutrality of their contributions. However, in this case, my particular my concern is the work the editor had done in his or her own sandbox (the now deleted  issues, this had not been demonstrated because all of his/her work (as far as I know) had been confined his/hers user sandbox. The editor was an obvious newbie, and had twice sought feedback (see here and here) and had been responsive to suggestions demonstrated by the removal of pervasive external links, downsizing of the article, rewriting so it was not in violation of WP:NOTDIR, and the addition of outside, neutral third-party references. In fact, although I did not see any of the editor's additions to this particular article since July 7th, in my opinion, it contained useful information, was notable, and was ready to be moved from the user space into Wikipedia proper. Mostly, I would request that this page be restored, as I would like to create that particular article myself and will not be able to duplicate the off-line references from various library science journals that had been inserted. I guess you could say that I primarily lament the loss of this particular article. I would appreciate your thoughts on this issue, and your review of the D-Scribe Digital Publishing article circa the July 7th version as I would like to see if there is anything salvageable from that (sans the copyright violations that Hammersoft elucidated).

Be sure that you are absolutely certain of the veracity of a fact and have done your research thoroughly before you write, add to, or edit an article. Otherwise readers will will receive misinformation and that is not what an encyclopaedia is intended for. The Winnipeg and city area articles are coming along quite nicely.

      "I too have no very clear idea about how to word an RfC, other than that it should be in relation to specific proposed changes to the MOS and not something vaguer. I also think it's very important to keep to the issue of diacritical marks in the original orthography of the language, and not stray into either additional letters (like eth or thorn) or the use of diacritical marks in transcription/transliteration (like retaining accents when going from πότε to póte or marking long vowels by macrons in transliterating a number of languages, including Greek and Japanese). These are separate issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problems, for me, are primarily in the first paragraph of WP:DIACRITICS, which is evasive, muddled and inconsistent:\n",
      " – this is just evasion. Their use or non-use should be motivated, and hence should be encouraged or discouraged according to the strength of the motivation.\n",
      " – this encouragement to count \"\"hits\"\" just results in muddled policy, apart from the problem of the weasel word \"\"general\"\". However, this bit seems clear that the \"\"modifications\"\" are to the same word, i.e. can be treated as stylistic modifications.\n",
      " This seems to me not to be consistent with the sentence before: is \"\"the common name\"\" here supposed to be with or without the added diacritical marks? \"\"[V]ersions of  word\"\" above should mean that \"\"the common \"\" is the same with or without the diacritical marks.\n",
      "Is it possible to re-write this paragraph to achieve consensus? I don't know.   \n",
      "\n",
      " Agreed those are separate issuesAgreed the first quoted passage is evasive, but motivating use or avoidance of diacritics seems to be the sticking point.  Did you have some particular direction in mind?  My take has been that if reliable sources show that their use is normal for the names in question that they should be used here, except where particular subjects eschew them. E.g. for a baseball player named Eddie Sandoval we'd give him as Eddie Sándoval if some reliable sources did (it can't be based on a majority of English language sources, since majority of them ignore diacritics entirely, as a matter of editorial/publishing convenience). It's the same principle that we can cite a single source for Eddie's birth date and place even if most sources don't mention them.  A fact does not have to be provided by every single source to be considered reliable.  And it's not a matter of sources conflicting (analogous to giving two different birth dates); some giving only Sandoval without the diacritics is like some sources giving a birth year but not a full birth date; it is incomplete information, not conflicting information.  On the other hand, if Eddie himself is quoted saying he doesn't use the diacritic that should be a trumping factor (unless WP totally ditches subject preference in all areas, which seems unlikely given the number of discussions going on to make more allowances for subject preference all over the place).  This can apply to geography, too (Santa Fe, New Mexico is \"\"Santa Fe\"\" not \"\"Santa Fé\"\" despite the popularity of the diacritic in certain circles; the official name of both the city and the county are \"\"Santa Fe\"\" with no accent. People frequently cite WP:OFFICIALNAME as if it were a policy, but it's actually just an essay, it may not accurately reflect the nuances in cases like this, and people often cite it without actually understanding what it says to begin with (it's frequently misinterpreted as being against use of official names, when it's really only against using them when they're directly unhelpful to readers, while otherwise we would almost certainly use the official name)I'm not sure \"\"general\"\" in the second passage is actually a weasel word, rather than just lack of clarity.  It's not clear if it means the predominant use in reliable sources generally, the predominant use in general-audience sources, or both.  The inclusion of \"\"and reference works\"\" strongly suggests the former.  Regardless, the \"\"hit-counting\"\" aspect is a problem because of the aforementioned facts that a) English-language sources tend to ignore diacritics for their own conven\n",

I saw the contributions filing last week and see Vondesaar, Homer's version of Theresa Obermeyer, is in second place with less than $200 for the quarter. Actually, I'm thinking he's actually more like that bag lady from FBX who ran Senate, was it, about 20 years ago.  Sylvia something? If Alaska were Nevada, \"\"None of the above\"\" could sweep the primaries and general elections. You live in Fairbanks? I had no idea.

I do remember that LeDoux hugely outraised Ogg, with most of her money coming from lawyers and labor from Anchorage. Can't remember if she had a general election opponent. She ran, unsuccessfully, for the house in 2000. Her mayor's win was nonpartisan, right?  \n",
      "\n",
      "Second, she moved to Anchorage not long after leaving her House seat.  She ran against Pete Petersen in 2010.  Petersen himself could also be classified as a carpetbagger, considering that he ran in 2004 against Bob Lynn, who represents a district clear on the opposite side of Anchorage.  Contrast the Petersen-LeDoux race with the first race in the new district in 2002, when media accounts specifically pointed out the deep roots that both Tom Anderson and Owen Carey had in East Anchorage.  \n",

      " \"\"Carpetbagger\"\" is a term that originally meant moving from a Northern state to run in the Deep South, after the Civil War, didn't it?  Moving a few miles in Anchorage would seem to be a bit of a stretch, to warrant that label.  Anderson's race of course was the one before McGuire made Tom stop wearing the wire and he was indicted at the end of his final year in the House. The only district which jogs my memory, unfortunately, was the kerfuffle over which district Valdez and maybe Whittier would be redistricted into in 2002. (Harris  scored?) Not nearly as big a to-do as Tuckerman's first massive gerrymandering attempt in 1992.   \"\n",

(The ability of Multics to dynamically link to a subroutine in any 'file' in the filesystem was a key thing in making this work - you could compile a new command, and then try it out right away, without having to link up a new version of the command interpreter.) Multics did always have the ability for anyone to start a subsidiary process, but it just wasn't used much.  (talk)\n",

Some of it is the same, but this is as some of the wording in the sector is fixed (and used across all relevant wikipedia pages), such as private sector development in conflict affected environments or sustainable poverty reduction/economic development.

Also its true that the modern Bulgarians are nothing turkic, as they are white europeans. Aren't Bulgarians white? Then what race are they? Croats are our closest relatives and they are proven by scientists. Also in many Bulgarian historical books it states clearly that the Bulgarians are closely related to the Hungarians and Croats as they were all part of one tribe in Eastern Europe. To include middle eastern as part of the Bulgarian genetic section is horrendous as it has nothing to do with the Bulgarian people. Mediterranean only partly. There are other evidence that states that Bulgaria has a stronger slavic influence like the Croats and the Slovenes, however there are some sources that claim they are separated from the tight slavic cluster together with the southern croats, serbs, macedonians and romanians. Both different sources should be respected but to include a middle eastern section is beyond belief, its a lie and totally ridiculous. Bulgarians are a mixture of slavic, alpine, dinaric, mediterranean, nordic and pontid. Pontids and the north pontids are about 50% of the population and they are a mix of atlanto mediterranean heritage and nordic people.\n",

      "- As somebody else said, the \"\"nation of Transylvania\"\" DOES NOT EXIST, it is pure ROMANIA and Romanians! Therefore, we will tell some real history here. Within the chronicles of Herodotus , one may find that he described the Dacians(Getae) as the nation living within the present Romanian and Moldavian territory, including the part that is called Transylvania today, which means “beyond the forests”, after the Latin definition given by Romans and which consisted of the Carpathian Mountains and the Pannonian Plains. A more accountable map can be found here: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Dacia_82_BC.png .. Therefore, the nation living there consisted of dacians, which were known as Geton (plural Getae) in Greek writings, and as Dacus (plural Daci) and Getae in Roman documents. The dacians were conquered, after great efforts, by the Romans and Dacia was transformed into a Roman Province. Following, it was  a period of Romanization, period when the main Romanian people rose. As an answer to the Magyar origin, the history says that their starting point within the actual Hungary is related to the invasion of the Mongols ruled by Genghis Han and the Huns ruled by Attila within the European territory. After their settlement within the Pannonian Plains, the Hungarian people emerged, by mixing with the local populations. As a clear conclusion, one may say that nobody can contradict the written past or the great historians in terms of the origin of Dacians and the territory within they lived, called today Transilvania/Transylvania. The truth that has to be admitted is that Dacians/Getae were here as a nation BEFORE the Hungarian people came over and rose as a nationality. Moreover, NEITHER the Mongols and Huns NOR the actual Hungarians WERE here BEFORE the Romanization of Dacians, therefore they were not present before the emerging stage of the Romanian people. International history admits that the Hungarians appeared within today’s Hungary territory around the 9th century A.C. (according to Britannica) as an immigrating people coming from the actual Tibet region/Mongolia. After settlement they conquered Transilvania and nowadays they fabricate they were first to live on this land. Bear in mind that Romanians will never stop claiming their internationally admitted origin, dating from Daco-Romans times and they will never stop viewing Trasilvania as their own home! If the Hungarians want to live without conflicts, they should stop claiming what does not belong to them, the Transylvania land. PEACE! \n",

Those dialects became known as \"\"Languages\"\" after diversification. Ishmael with his mother moved to the Arabic concentrated area. Ishmael learned Arabic and married an Arab girl. He begot Arab children from their mothers side. Those children again married Arab. This continued until those children became a big tribe called Quraysh or Quraish, reknowed for the perfection of their dialect of Arabic & for being a strong and honored tribe among the Arabs. Their DNA would have been diluted nearly completely by the Arab tribe Ishmael joined. But as we know the Y chromasome is passed down by the father. Hence it is relavent to state that Quraysh's male population would have had a great affinity geneticly to Ishmael, the non-Arab. Yet Maternaly they would have had a greater affinity to the other Arab tribes. by BB\"\n",

      "Dear Macrakis: I was the one who gave that exact solution in the first place. The golden ratio naturally appears in the 5th roots of unity; if you plot the roots in the complex plane, they form the vertices of a pentagon. This then explains why you can express a lot of trigonometric angles pi*n/5 in terms of the golden ratio. For example, cos 18 = (b/4)sqrt[2] = 5^(1/4)/2 sqrt[φ].  When you solve a quintic equation, naturally the fifth roots of unity are involved, hence why the radical solution of the quintic x^5-5x+12 = 0 can be expressed in terms of the golden ratio.  I hope it is clearer now.\n",

For proof that de Moivre's theorem is true for all ℚ at the very least (though no actual proof is given) please see pg 36 of book with ISBN number: 978-0-435519-21-6. Un-fortuitously I am unaware of any books that provide a proof beyond an integer power but I have already provided a proof and if you find that insufficient I can provide you with other internet sources that cite it. I can understand and forgive a non-mathematical page containing errors as non-mathematical phenomena are not clear cut nor are they ever entirely obvious and often it is plausible to find support for all sets of contradicting information. However this is not the case with mathematics which is the only subject that can have all of its information conclusively proved or disproved. As such maths should never be quoted incorrectly in any Wikipedia article as it is extremely black and white, i.e; things are either purely correct or incorrect and as it stands my corrections were correct whereas the current page reversion is not. I am amazed at how this page is able to pertain information of such mass, gross inaccuracy especially given the simplicity of de Moivre's theorem and the prerequisites needed to understand it. It is after all something that all students of complex numbers by extension of studying further mathematics learn at the age of 16 in England, UK. Though I appreciate that even a graduate of a masters in mathematics may be mis-informed on this subject given that they have never studied complex numbers but as such they should not consider themselves versed enough to be able to misinform others by way or publishing erroneous statements in this article.

And you couldn't even be bothered to let me know there might be a problem. I hope our paths never cross again but I suppose I'll have to watch your contributions in future to make sure you aren't deleting everything I do. What a waste of time. Oh yeah - I'll assume you were smashing in good faith. As if. Thanks for ruining my (formerly) good mood, as I was enjoying making some useful contributions to Wikipedia articles.   \n",
      "Welcome to Wikipedia. Now, a recap. With this edit you added a link to the current MPs list, for Carter. Problem was it was for David Carter, not John Carter so I removed it. I went to replace it with one for John Carter, but there is none, so I couldn't. You then added another link, but like the first one it too went to the wrong person, this time, Cam Calder. I removed it with the edit summary \"\"Cannot replace it because Carter is no longer an mp\"\". You have responded by inserting a brand new link to Former MPs. I was unaware Carter has been added to that list, but that is beside the point because I was removing links to current MPs. If you intend to edit Wikipedia for a while I suggest you don't shout in your edit summaries as you did with \"\"Former MPs DO HAVE WORKING LINKS. Wikipedians fix links rather than delete them\"\",  and you address the actual issue and don't jump to conclusions.   \n",
      "Not true! The actual issue was that you deleted ALL the links I added for him. That is the recap. The two other links worked fine, but you deleted them as well in your hurry to smash everything someone else did. In other words, you are the one who jumped to conclusions. Now you're trying to claim you only deleted the one that was a problem. Even your edit summary is wrong. The man's resignation was presented the same day I was adding the links, unknown to me, so it seems the Parliament link was being moved from current to former which caused pointer problems when I clicked on it. Things happen. It only needed to be fixed. I would have thought an Admin would be capable of figuring that out. Nor could you figure out how to leave a message on my Talk page so I could figure it out. You just couldn't wait to smash everything. I only came back to the article because I was going through the non-Cabinet people on the list. Did you fix that list, once you realized this was a former MP? No, you did not. That would have been \"\"work\"\", requiring \"\"thought\"\" and \"\"effort\"\". Same as you mis-corrected the hat note on the other John Carter MP. Based on your arrogance, I thought it likely you were an Admin. What a surprise, I was right. And Jimbo wonders why the numbers of actual contributors are going straight downhill. I have NO intention of continuing to contribute to Wikipedia because you obviously would prefer to do everything yourself. You're not at all welcoming, helpful, polite, assuming good faith, or anything else I was led to believe is part of the Wikipedia ethos. So I leave you to it. You didn't even have the grace to apologize for deleting the other links, you just tried to blame me in this audit trail. Go lecture someone else, because I'm out of here, and you can be sure I won't be encouraging anyone else to participate in what could have been a good project. Your attitude is horrendous, and I'm sure I'm not the first one you've chased out of here. Well, keep it up and you'll soon have the whole thing to yourself. Enjoy.

      "I'll layout my mindset when writing Dennis Lo.  The employer contacted me because he had previously worked with me on another project unrelated to this.  He asked if I could write up an article.  I told him I needed 3 days to decide if I would take the job to determine if an article could even be written that was met guidelines.  I determined that there was, accepted the job, and wrote it.  Now, could the article have been written by anyone without getting paid?  Yes.  In fact, red links for Dennis Lo already existed in two other articles.  I gathered as many sources as I could and wrote what they said.  Did that prohibit me from being critical?  As seen in the Tops In Blue article, I can be critical of topics I have a COI in (I have a friend who was in TiB at the time I rewrote that article).  So what does payment get the employer?  Well, he doesn't have to wait for some random disinterested party to get around to writing it.  They arn't buying my integrity, it's not for sale.  They arn't buying my bit, that's not mine in the first place.  As far as I am concerned, me getting paid gets me to write in topic areas I normally wouldn't.  That's the only 'effect' it has on me.  I'm much more interested in this project than picking up some crappy freelance job that's going to lead to me being asked to leave.  My guess is that most established editors feel the same way.  I can see where paid editing firms who hire folks who have never touched Wikipedia is a bad thing, but for those of us who have put our hearts into this project, you're making a very offensive claim that we arn't fully committed to the success of this thing.v/r - P\n",

It is true that the servers don't spend much time on redirects, but I still would like all links going directly to the article they refer to.  Not that that will ever happen to all of WP, or even EN WP, but I can help.  Actually, I started fixing the redirecting links to that particular page because I wanted to make sure there were no double redirects, which would be a problem, and one worth fixing.  Being a perfectionist, I decided to go ahead and fix all the redirecting links instead of just the double redirects (I want a nice, clean Whatlinkshere page, with no indentions ).  A large percentage of the redirects I am fixing are on (main) namespace pages, not on talk pages, and in those cases I also fix the visible spelling of the link when it is wrong, since that should be right.  So I am doing what you were saying about fixing the article pages.  On talk pages (and even in archives), I have been fixing the appearance as well as the link target, but I think I'll change my policy based on your well-made point: I'm only going to change the link target, nothing about the appearance.

In particular, you'll have to find some sections to tighten up, and once you've done that I think there are some that could use further expansion.  Personally, I think that the section on equipment should be significantly tightened, leaving some room elsewhere, but I don't really know.  Also, I was about to add it to the ACR, but this is just as good, you're missing one of the conflicts in the immediate aftermath of the war (and as a matter of fact an area where troops were deployed in East Africa during the war), Somaliland.  See 1920 conflict between British forces and Somaliland dervishes and Hastings_Ismay#Somaliland (which gives a good account of the conflict, though just from the perspective of one soldier).  I don't think you need to do any more than mention the conflict, but a good source is  if you want it.\n",

How does a government decide how many credits ought to be issued (for free, I assume) to each entity before trading begins?  Indeed, most questions about emissions trading boil down to this very question.  For example, if an auction is used, and the auction is efficient, economics would predict that no trades would take place post-auction (the occurrence of such trades would imply that the auction had been improper)  making the whole concept of \"\"cap and trade\"\" actually mean \"\"cap via auction\"\".

      "Okay, media commentator and related matters.  I repeat the text you suggested above:Ijaz has also served as a media commentator, frequently writing opinion pieces and appearing on television news programs over the past two decades. He was exclusively retained by Fox News in the period immediately following the September 11 attacks, appearing on Fox programs over 100 times. He was a popular guest on the network's Special Report broadcast.Do you have any source that states all of this, and/or a collection of sources that together state this?  In this situation, we can't simply cite your opinion pieces, because no single opinion piece is good for \"\"frequently writing\"\", and taking a bunch of opinion pieces and saying \"\"see, it's frequently\"\" is the kind of thing addressed by our no-original-synthesis standard.  \"\"Appearing on TV news...\"\" This is slightly different, since a few references to TV appearances over the years would establish that you weren't a one-time guest, but again a secondary source would help by demonstrating that TV appearances were significant.  Although I know you're not a mediæval soldier, the retainer thing is a rather specific detail that really shouldn't appear unless we have a source for it — could you find something published by Fox, or something from somewhere else, noting that they'd officially retained you?  As I noted above, I looked for sources of this sort but was unable to find them.  Finally, about a Further reading section — do you know of any books that talk about you at length in a favorable light?

I try hard to assume good faith, and I certainly would like to have the same assumed of my actions.  Having contributed a number of userboxes, and finding them deleted without notice, I was confused.  Upon digging deeper, I saw that the problem was much more serious that a few templates being deleted out of process.  There are a number of admins that seem to think that they have the right to dictate to the masses what is and is not acceptable content in the user space.  This is wrong.  User space is where wikipedians are allowed to express their POV, personal convictions, and interests.  Admins do have a responsibility to wikipedia, but first and foremost it should be recognized that wikipedia only exists because of wikipedians.  Actions such as mass purges, mass deletions, and mass edits without explanation, are basically the most disruptive possible avenue available.  In the grand scheme of things, userboxes are basically unimportant, but they have become the most critical issue on the wikipedia at present because they have been attacked by administrators without comment or explanation, outside of process, and with no regard for the impact this has on the community.  I am unhappy with your part in this, Tony, and I expected better.  I feel that admins should learn from their mistakes, and the mistakes of others, but I am afraid I see these being repeated.  If you feel you have the right, then you are welcome to exercise it - but you will destroy the wikipedia if you destroy the desire of wikipedians to participate.  I think you should take some time to admire the forest before you start chopping down the trees that others have planted with love.\n",

You have achieved by adding rebuttals within the science section in homeopathic doses what I could not by being I gather too straightforward.

But, ILike2BeAnonymous removed the NPOV tag without making a single contribution to rebalance the NPOV equilibrium.  I gather he thought my tag amounted to vandalism.

The slides showing what such a sea level rise looks like (maps of cities, states, countries) are pretty dramatic.  But, they have absolutely no scientific bearing.  The IPCC forecasts a sea level rise ranges from several inches inches to just 3 feet in the worst case scenario.

Thirdly, you somehow \"\"forget\"\" that whether the minorities (not only Slovak) have a \"\"weak identity\"\" or not, the Hungarian government - unlike the governements of all its neighbouring countries - has abolished schools with the respective languages as languages of instruction (you can play with words, but that is a fact), bilingual schools - even if they would work, which they did not - are not enough and above all there was absolutely no reason for such a deterioration other then finishing the Magyarisation (and this aim was successfully achieved).

      "Even if there were ambiguity about whether FISA, read together with the AUMF, permits the President to authorize the NSA activities, the canon of constitutional avoidance requires reading these statutes in harmony to overcome any restrictions in FISA and Title III, at least as they might otherwise apply to the congressionally authorized armed conflict with al Qaeda. Indeed, were FISA and Title III interpreted to impede the President’s ability to use the traditional tool of electronic surveillance to detect and prevent future attacks by a declared enemy that has already struck at the homeland and is engaged in ongoing operations against the United States, the constitutionality of FISA, as applied to that situation, would be called into very serious doubt. In fact, if this difficult constitutional question had to be addressed, FISA would be unconstitutional as applied to this narrow context. Importantly, the FISA Court of Review itself recognized just three years ago that the President retains constitutional authority to conduct foreign surveillance apart from the FISA framework, and the President is certainly entitled, at a minimum, to rely on that judicial interpretation of the Constitution and FISA.\n",

On another front, I think we ought to leave the dating issue where it stands, even though I disagree with Heylin's assessment of mid-July, which he guesses at based on the fact that BoB made its debut on the charts on July 30 (see Shades, p. 264). I find that ridiculous. For example, BIABH took six weeks from its official release on March 7, 1965, to reach the charts (May 8). Highway 61 got out much quicker, with a one-month lapse from its August 20 release before charting. Going back earlier, Another Side took about six weeks to chart and Freewheelin', more about than three months,  Using mid-July, then, means giving BoB  two weeks to debut, which is absurd. Of course, the whole problem centers on what is meant by \"\"release.\"\" In this case, it's being used to mean distribution, which was obviously delayed in BoB's case. However, the Billboard advertisement of June 25 gives at least three other clues to that: pressing, packaging and promotion. With those three in place, distribution couldn't have been more than a week behind if not already in motion.   \"\n",

The testicle cuffs extended between the legs, and each man was connected to the next by a rope between their genitals. These tight metal bindings on their scrotums were to ensure that a quick pace was kept, for if a man were to stop walking the rope would pull and cause quick, sharp pain in the genital region. doesn't sound vaguely historical, source it or I'll remove it.\n",

      "In 1982, he joined Starbucks Coffee Company in Seattle as the Director of Marketing. After a business trip to Milan, Italy, he tried to get ownership (including Gerry Baldwin) to offer traditional espresso beverages in addition to the whole bean coffee, leaf teas and spices they had long offered. After a successful pilot of the cafe concept, the owners refused to roll it out company-wide and Howard Schultz started his own coffee shop named Il Giornale in 1985. Two years later, the original Starbucks management were forced to focus on Peet's Coffee & Tea because of bullying and harrassment and sold its Starbucks retail unit to Schultz and Il Giornale. The former owners do not speak favorably of Schultz in interviews to this day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Schultz renamed Il Giornale with the Starbucks name and aggressively expanded Starbucks' reach across the United States. It can be said that Starbucks popularized espresso drinks such as the cafe latte to many Americans who had previously only ever tasted freeze dried coffee.They later acquired HEAR music and formed Concord Management Group in an attempt at music management and distribution using Starbucks stores. Schultz also became a board member on Dreamworks, trying to establish film output.He began his obsession with Angelina Jolie when she was at a very young age and saw to it that she rose to the celebrity status in her career. It is rumored that the success of the Ray Charles cd fueled Schultz' ambition to murder Charles in an attempt to secure the success of the film. Over the years, he is linked to the deaths of other actors such as Heath Ledger, Anna Nicole Smith, Tupac Shakur, and Notorious BIG. Unfortunately, he is affiliated with a secret group called *Velvet Mafia* in Hollywood. They are rumored to be gay, be responsible for removing Michael Ovitz from his CAA post with a huge power move and stalks young women and men for years to get ideas for their projects. Other members includes David Geffen, Jeffrey Katzenburg, Calvin Klein, Tom Ford, and Michael Eisner amongst some others. This has earned him a bad reputation within the Hollywood community. His latest effort to bring his company back on track, he has unaffiliated himself from Concord Management and Dreamworks. However, Starbucks employees have been neglected, mistreated, stalked, harrassed, smeared and defamed under Schultz's management and have repeatedly plagued the company with multi million dollar lawsuits and won. The latest smear attempt came when a 16 year old barista was sexually harrassed by Starbucks management in Irvine, California. In his recent Portfolio magazine in July 2008, he responded to his employees calling him a *psychopath* by suggesting that they should just listen to what the leader of their company tells them. Schultz didn't believe in franchising. Because of this Starbucks owns every domestic outlet with one exception. Schultz went 50-50 with Magic Johnson on stores in minority communities. Others believe the reason why he doesn't franchise I'd because he would like to have access to the video recordings of his employees for private use.\n",

The legal sense is not for me to determine.  The informal sense?  Um, try to interpret this as anything but slander:  \"\"I think it's going to come out that the only reason she got any books published at all was because her rich daddy was a huge big deal in the publishing world. And the reason she can't get any books published anymore is because her big rich daddy is retired now and no longer a heavyweight at all in that world.\"\" - Qworty. Not only do I interpret this as slander, but so do sober people on Wikipedia. And I quote Tvoz, with respect to your slander: \"\"Well, I think there certainly are questionable, maybe defamatory, allegations there, and it would seem that BLP policy is not being fully followed. This is a long-time editor who is well aware of policy, so suggesting that he/she step back was appropriate as a first step to diffuse the drama, and I see that the next step I expected, of asking the editor to remove the material him/herself, has been done at User talk:Qworty#BLP concerns by a well-respected admin. But policy calls for the material to be removed either voluntarily by its author or by any editor, as we have an obligation to not defame our subjects, even in the heat of argument.\"\" For what it's worth, the word \"\"defamatory\"\" is in fact a legal designation. Moreover, if I were discussing the law - which I'm not - then I would be using the term \"\"libel,\"\" which covers written/published defamation, as opposed to slander, which - in the strict legal sense - pertains to speech.   \"\n",

You changed other BLPs from British to English with no sourcing and again with the bands.

We made a compromise with Whitesnake, but there really doesn't have to be a compromise because these articles are technically correct already. There's got to be a bit of give and take. Also, racing drivers and teams all have British licences, not English / Scottish / Welsh etc, so you're right to change the Scottish ones to British, but not the British ones to English.

      "Godwin devised his Law (and others built on it) with reference to discussions such as the one on this Talk page. Its antecedents lie in Reductio ad Hitlerum, also called argumentum ad Hitlerum, or reductio (or argumentum) ad Nazium – dog Latin for \"\"reduction (or argument) to Adolf Hitler (or the Nazis)\"\" – a modern informal fallacy in logic. It is a variety of both questionable cause and association fallacy. The phrase reductio ad Hitlerum was coined by an academic ethicist, Leo Strauss, in 1953. Engaging in this fallacy is sometimes known as playing the Nazi card. Doing so (that is, playing the Nazi card) destroys one's credibility, which is why you have been patiently advised not to do it. If indeed Patiwat initiated the article on Banjerd Singkaneti, note that he also included the protest of The Embassy of Israel as published in the Bangkok Post. That protest, strictly my POV of course, demolishes Banjerd's credibility. Notice, however, that that is MY POV; others, who prefer not to be confused by facts, would believe that it is the Israelis' credibility that has been demolished. As for your credibility, write now I think you incredibly angry, which is not a bad thing to be, if only you learn to focus it properly. If you do learn to focus properly, then you will find that you and Patiwat are allies opposed to the policies of PAD as practiced in present-day Thailand, without reference to what went wrong in the middle of the last century in the middle of Europe.   \"\n",

When I looked at them it became obvious that they are non-notable per WP:MUSIC. I nominated the the articles and I then made pertinent comments in that AFD as any nominator would. I never accused you do doing anything surreptitiously, just pointed out that you had an interest in the outcome of the decision beyond simply being the author of the article. I even broached the bad faith subject. If you were conficent that the articles satisfied WP:MUSIC then you should have stated so in a reasoned, sourced, referenced argument and allowed it to stand up to scrutiny. If the consensus was that they met notability standards (beyond your simple assertion that they did) then the articles would have withstood review. I even offered to change my opinion if you could demonstrate notability. Last I heard, \"\"because WebHamster\"\" says so is not a reliable independent source that i am aware of, nor is that stated anywhere on in WP. (note: You'll notice that I took no action on Mo Foster - because a quick search revealed the at least a prima facia notability, which The Hamsters could not assert)  \"\n",

I'm not the least bit sure that the USAF's \"\"Air Force Historical Studies Office\"\", which is \"\"headquartered at the Pentagon\"\", meets the criteria for WP:NPOV. Indeed, I suggest that it is very appropriate to use caution regarding any weight attributed to the USAF's analysis of actions performed by the USAF (see WP:Conflict of Interest). Especially as it regards to such controversial operations, (the USAF investigating the actions of the USAF are akin to the police investigating the conduct of police officers - heavy bias is inevitable). Further more, it may be argued that such a source violates WP:Primary Source.\n",
      "Batvette, the \"\"air force historical society[sic] analysis of Dresden firebombing that you have provided place's some emphasis on the military value of Dresden as a target for strategic bombing. It refers to Dresden's value as a transport and communications hub, (see para II). It also refers to \"\"[s]pecific military installations in Dresden in February 1945 included barracks and hutted camps and at least one munitions storage depot\"\", (see para II.10). Perversely, one of the arguments suggested for legitimising the bombing was the fact that Dresden \"\"was protected by antiaircraft defenses, antiaircraft guns and searchlights\"\", (see para 11). I'm not at all sure what to make of that bizarre reference.\n",

      "The historian Alexander McKee has cast doubt on the meaningfulness of the list of targets mentioned in 1953 USAAF report and point out that the military barracks listed as a target were a long way out of town and not in fact targeted during the raid.McKee (1983), p. 61,62 The 'hutted camps' mentioned in the report as military targets were also not military but were provided for refugees. It is also pointed out that the important Autobahn bridge to the west of the city was not targeted or attacked and that no railway stations were on the British target maps, nor were the bridges, such as the railway bridge spanning the Elbe River.McKee (1982), pp.62,63. Commenting on this Alexander McKee stated that: \"\"The standard whitewash gambit, both British and American, is to mention that Dresden contained targets X, Y and Z, and to let the innocent reader assume that these targets were attacked, whereas in fact the bombing plan totally omitted them and thus, except for one or two mere accidents, they escaped\"\"McKee (1983), p.61. McKee further asserts, \"\"The bomber commanders were not really interested in any purely military or economic targets, which was just as well, for they knew very little about Dresden; the RAF even lacked proper maps of the city. What they were looking for was a big built up area which they could burn, and that Dresden possessed in full measure\"\"McKee (1983), p.63.\n",

R. Allen said, \"\"The final phase of Bomber Command's operations was far and away the worst. Traditional British chivalry and the use of minimum force in war was to become a mockery and the outrages perpetrated by the bombers will be remembered a thousand years hence\"\"McKee (1983), p. 315.

      "\n",
      "Regarding the writer at http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html and referenced at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hitler_salute please note the following:  Mr. Barlow is a nutter with an obsession. The history of the salute is now improved in the Roman salute article (which had many previous visits from Dr. Curry in the past - see its talk page- as Dr. Curry attempted to correct the many errors). The pact between the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is not well known, and is also not covered widely on Wikipedia, so it is \"\"covered up\"\" by people, and those people also often refer to it as the \"\"Nazi-Soviet\"\" pact (as the writer above does) which avoids ever using the actual name of the horrid Party (the National Socialist German Workers' Party) and reinforces the hackneyed use of the shorthand \"\"Nazi\"\" and the myth that members of the National Socialist German Workers' Party referred to themselves as \"\"Nazis\"\" (they did not refer to themselves as \"\"Nazis\"\").  Some people (note the writer above) try to evade the point with odd comments such as \"\"It wasn't invented by Wikipedia editors to conceal the word 'socialism'!\"\"  That comment does not dispute the fact that there are people who use the word \"\"Nazi\"\" to avoid ever stating the actual name of the party: The National Socialist German Workers' Party. Not only is that done in the title of the page cited (the “Nazi-Soviet pact” page) it is done on that entire article where the actual name of the Party never appears nor even the phrase \"\"National Socialist.\"\" The writer above also makes constant use of the shorthand \"\"Nazi\"\" even when discussing the very topic at hand.  The Bellamy salute was not originally the same as the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party, as noted by Professor Curry. However, as anyone who looks at Dr. Curry's historic photographs of the salute can see, it developed into the same salute as that of the National Socialist German Workers' Party. Even the writer above concedes Dr. Curry's point that the flag was saluted with a normal military-style salute and then the arm was straightened out toward the flag during the oath. The writer above tellingly evades the point that the use of the military salute led to the change in the salute to the U.S. flag.  It is as if the writer above is conceding the point made by Professor Curry. Indeed, the writer seems to concede it with the comment \"\"Anyway, even if the gesture had been the same, so what? It's just a gesture. The Soviets used conventional salutes, does that mean that the US military are Communists because they use the same gesture as the Soviet military!\"\"   It is fascinating how the writer again avoids the actual name \"\"Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\"\" and also uses the term \"\"Communist\"\" instead of using the term \"\"Socialist.\"\"  The writer then attempts to avoid the issue, which is the origin of the straight-arm salute, and tries to turn the issue into an odd argument about whether salutes dictate particular dogmas.  Nevertheless, the writer evades the topic that Professor Curry has raised, which is that Francis Bellamy and Edward Bellamy were  self-proclaimed National Socialists in the USA three decades before the National Socialist German Workers' Party, and Edward's book was an international bestseller, translated into every major language (including German, which Edward spoke and wrote, and where Edward had studied as a young man) and that Edward's dogma inspired \"\"Nationalism\"\" clubs worldwide including in Germany. \n",
      "\n",
      "    Yes, the \"\"Roman salute\"\" page did once contain inaccuracies, and the writer above is to be thanked for conceding that point. But that is no reason for the writer to blabber with his use of the term \"\"conspiracy.\"\" It's just what you get when you have an open encyclopedia! The point is to correct error when you see it, and to not delete those corrections when they are made by people like Dr. Curry.   The John Seigenthaler story from Brian Chase is another notorious example of Wikipedia’s untrustworthiness.  On Wikipedia, the intellectually dishonest administrators block people who tell the truth, so it is specious to say that truth-tellers simply need to correct the articles.  \n",
      "\n",
      "    The writer above also concedes that he is the Wikipedia editor who \"\"became wiser\"\", by incorporating Professor Curry's discoveries.  The writer is to be thanked for crediting Dr. Curry with making it more widely available. It should be noted that the valuable information that Professor Curry provides is his own discovery.  Dr. Curry has also mentioned that the material about the use of the Roman salute in films derives from an academic article by Martin Winkler. Professor Curry pointed out that Martin Winkler did not realize at the time of Winkler's article that the films were all pre-dated by the use of the salute in the U.S. Pledg\n",

(He seems to think that Wikipedia is his whole world and is the entire internet, and it is not. Nice. http://rexcurry.net/wikipedia-lies.html ) Anyway, Matt's only response was to make off-topic childish remarks and  here's the genius part  when Matt's own childish remarks (similar to Matt's reply above) are repeated back to Matt in an effort to show Matt his childishness (and to mock Matt) Matt becomes mad and remains clueless.  I suppose Matt thinks that when he does this, he's done something very clever. Sadly, Matt's debating style is much favoured by schoolchildren: make off-topic childish remarks and stalk accurate writers with his \"\"nah-nee-nah\"\" voice. It is amusing, though, to see Matt (a grown-up?) do it.  Here are the points that Matt never addresses, does not dispute, but always tries to delete so that other wikipedians will not know: \n",

      "The infobox doc has the standard format as \"\"www.example.com\"\" and the Official link at the bottom of the page was directed to www.ev.com so I followed that pattern as well.  Also, as you mentioned, most other pages have the www. on there as well. Most of the time the reasoning is because when visiting the domain without the \"\"www.\"\" subdomain, it redirects to it with the \"\"www.\"\" anyway.  Apparently this is not the case with the Evanescence website (as I have just verified).  I was really just looking for consistency, though.  Since the Ev pages all had \"\"www.\"\" listed, I kept it consistent by making the infobox the same.  I agree that Evanescence.com looks better.  However, all official channels such as their official twitter page (as well as Amy Lee's official twitter page), the official youtube page, and even the WindUp records website links to \"\"www.Evanescence.com\"\".

Because both books were written prior to the 1967 discovery of the \"\"lost\"\" journal, they both contain some errors in particulars of the 1826-27 travel route that were corrected in Brooks' book (1977).

The only ntl event I have not seen the full draw for  in '69 is Laver's win at Orlando over Rosewall. I saw your link to the warehouse talk and I am very pleased that someone has tracked down this extra match at the Dutch round robin. I use to think this was a 4 man rr, but found out it was 8 man with 2 groups of 4 earlier this year. There were some upsets at this event with Ralston  beating Rosewall on clay.  On the 1963 results I am slightly suspicious of Laver winning twice by the same score 6-0, 6-3 at MSG; once in the 6 man phase and once in the final play-off phase.\n",

      "\"CCD affecting other insects?==\n",
      "While all this is certainly entertaining, the qoute does not stand on its own in that even if all honeybee populations collapse, mankind will not disappear. Wild pollinator insects, animals, and even wind can still pollinate many even most edible food crops. Even if those crops that depend solely on domestic bee pollenation cannot be produced any longer, humans would adapt agriculture to fill those niches.  \n",
      "\n",
      "At this point it's not clear yet that CCD only affects bees.  It certainly stands to reason that other insects could be affected by the same disorder.  Also, the quote may be overly simplified.  But the big picture is that without pollinators, things are much more difficult. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have not seen any references that have indicated that wild bee populations, wild pollinators or other insects have been affected by the same disorder. If you know of any references that cite a similar decline in native or wild pollinators it may be helpful to include a section on this. \n",
      "Wild bees are generally becoming rare in the Western world due to habitat destruction. This is AFAIK most severe in C Europe.  \n",
      "I agree that wild bees are increasingly rare worldwide, but the cause has little if anything to do with colony collapse.  \n",
      "\"\"Little if anything\"\"? The proper and correct response is it has nothing to do with CCD. Even in the event that CCD should prove to be a \"\"disease\"\", diseases are rather specific in what they affect, and a disease that affects honey bees is unlikely to affect any other insects; and there are only 7 species of honey bees. It's like expecting that a disease that affects deer will spread to other mammals, such as humans. That is an unreasonable expectation - it most definitely does NOT \"\"stand to reason that other insects could be affected by the same disorder\"\" - the reality is exactly the opposite. The seven species in the genus Apis have had something on the order of 35 million years of independent evolution - 35 million years for their genomes to diverge from those of all other insects; compare that to the 70 million years mammals have existed. The human genome has had about as much time to diverge from deer, as the honey bee genome has had to diverge from other bees. But no one expects humans and deer to be affected by the same diseases. Why should a honey bee disease affect other bees?\n",
      "While it is certainly true that habitat destruction and climate change are major threats to pollinating insects, bees foremost among them, CCD, even in a worst-case scenario, is not a threat to anything outside of agriculture.  \n",

That and that alone makes me unsuitable for editing any WP article whatsoever. I also think that it is those very rules and policies that gut any integrity a so called minority view article could ever have. The only thing the WP rules and policies have accomplished at the AS article is to prevent useful, important and thoroughly verified information to be included, at the same time irrelevant and factually false claims have been inflated and scattered all through the article. There is no integrity there, very little informative value and a high degree of distortion. If that is the WP idea of \"\"integrity\"\", then that is an integrity not worth protecting. And isn't WP supposed to the free and public encyclopedia? If that is the case, why should we be bound by any dictates from Jimmy Wales? We are the editors, not him. He may have founded it, but we are the ones upholding it. By the logic employed by some editors here, the government should be allowed to have total control of the internet, because it was government that \"\"created\"\" the internet. That is the principle WP seems to follow, and I reject that principle. I also submit that any rule and policy that is so demonstrably destructive as those employed in editing the AS article can and should be altered or abolished.   \"\n",

Since the meet-up I've been taken up by the meat of the August-January college football season (I'm really active there), so I've admittedly been a bit lax on paying as much attention to the Minnesota articles during this period (other than those on my watchlist which, since you got me for not using the same number, currently stands at 1,092 w/o talk pages ;-) ).

Visit the other sites, none of them have this info and this is just one instance. You are wrong about it being the normal material. Also after paying attention to this site for sometime, it has continued to be the first in announcing tour dates for Rogers tour, and apparently has already secured a interview with one of Rogers bandmates. While you may think that the videos on the site are annoying, many fans love this. I am one of them, I cant think of another site where I can view much of the videos on this site. You say its difficult to navigate and I laugh at that, there is a simple naviagtion bar at the left hand side of each page, just like fleeting glimpses bar.

The Huns, the Hephthalites, the Rouran, and even the Turks and Mongols were coalitions of a bunch of different nomadic tribes of all kinds of origins - from Indo-Iranian Scythians to Siberian proto-Altaics. Yet, we have to have SOME standard in here. And the best way to do that is to stick to authoritative sources. \n",
      " The EI and EIr are collections of major sources and quotes; both Ei and EIr make clear that neather the Chionites nor the Hephthalites (or Gök-Turks) were homogenous. As for the Hephthalites, the usage of Mongolian and Turkic titles (such as Khaqan) is attested in the scripts of Bactria. Yet, the ruling elite was most probable of Eastern Iranian origin. That's why Chinese sources, such as the \"\"Pey-Shi\"\" considered them members of the \"\"Yüe-Chi\"\", who were Indo-European Tocharians. We can't just assume certain origins because of some royal titles. Not everyone who used the title \"\"Khaqan\"\" was automatically a Turk or Mongol. The best example for this is the Indo-European title \"\"Yabghu\"\" (probably from Tocharian or Iranian) whi was almost exclusively used by Non-Indo-European Turks. Now, we can assume that - at some point in history - the early Turks were ruled by an Indo-European-speaking elite (probably Tocharian or Iranian Scythian), but this is not enough to call the early Turks a \"\"mix of Indo-European and Altaic peoples\"\" (see Turkic peoples). \n",

You're right that the total energy is much higher in the rest frame of one of the protons, but it's the center-of-momentum energy that matters, because the cheapest way to make new particles is at relative rest. By the way, you can calculate your result much more easily by using the fact that the dot product of four-vectors is frame invariant: (7 TeV, 7 TeV) · (7 TeV, -7 TeV) = (mp, 0) · (E, E), so E = 49 TeV2 / mp ≈ 52,000 TeV.

That is, the website of the central government uses other romanizations than the websites of the regions. For instance, the website of Gomel Region uses Yelsk and Oktiabrskiy, while the website of the central government uses Elsk and Oktyabrskii. In addition, in your sandbox I find forms that are used on neither website. You write Svietlahorsk while both the central government website and the Gomel Region website use Svetlogorsk.\n",

      " in others, iotation/palatalization is marked using the letter y: Oktyabrskii, Kostyukovka;\n",
      " in yet others, the letter i is used for the same purpose: Liozno;\n",
      " in still others, the letter j is employed: Marjina Gorka;\n",
      " sometimes, in one part of the word iotation/palatalization is marked, while it isn't in another part of the same word: Myadel (Cyrillic , pronounced ).\n",
      " the ending  is inconsistently romanized. Compare Oktyabrskii and Pervomaiskiy (as a bonus, observe that the first i in Pervomaiskiy is a transcription of , which on the rest of the map is usually transcribed as y'').\n",
      "\n",
      "Observing these inconsistencies, I am not convinced that using these romanizations is the solution. While BGN/PCGN may not be perfect, it is at least consistent. If this, this and this are the alternatives, I think we should stick to our existing policy of using BGN/PCGN. -\n",

      "First off, your baseless accusations. You accused me of bad faith. Precious. As recently as yesterday you refereed to the inclusion of Dado Prso's first name in the article (as is the case on hundreds of other sportspeople bios throughout Wiki), as a \"\"Serb nationalist talking point\"\", a \"\"thinly veiled political advocacy\"\", and an \"\"unverified Serbian name claim\"\", also back in 2006 you were dismissive of the AFP source, at one point even calling for Prso's ID scan. When I brought this up, your response was calling it a figment of my imagination and making ridiculous accusations of bad faith!? You also accused me of proving a point, basing it on my mere presence here. The only reason I'm here posting on this page now is your removal of Prso's first name based on a claim that its inclusion is \"\" tendentious & unreferenced\"\". Clearly there are and there have been references on this page all along. Frankly I found it extremely unlikely that someone as nit-picky and anal as you would fail to notice the references on the talk page when you removed the first name from the article, but I guess it's possible. Also, as per your \"\"I (Joy) didn't overlook anything - none of these links were referenced in the article or in the talk page\"\" claim, it is not true. The first three links I presented to you just above have been on this talk page page for 8 years (and the AFP story from the FIFA official page is among them) and you clearly were aware of them back in 2006 as the ANON referenced them when addressing you directly and you even mention some explicitly yourself in your responses. So assuming in good faith that your failure to notice them now in 2014 was an honest oversight on your part I have to inform you once again that you DID overlook them because they've been here all this time. For the dissection of the Nezavisne ref, I'm not even sure what you're pushing and arguing for there. Nobody on this page, least of all me, has disputed that he goes by Dado (the article is called Dado Prso in case you failed to notice that too) so why you felt compelled to argue that is beyond me. From the best that I could gather, you don't want his first name Miladin in the intro, but you can live with it in the 'early career' section and you're basing all of this this on the fact that when you total them up most references are to Dado and Miladin, which is completely ridiculous, IF this is what you're arguing for (if not forget the previous sentence). Yes, of course they're to Dado, this is what he goes by, but that doesn't negate his first name.  \"\n",

I speak French and when I visited Belgium, their French was completely comprehensible, with the exception of a few odd words like \"\"septant\"\" rather than \"\"soixant-dix\"\" for \"\"seventy\"\", etc). Also, you said something about you \"\"being too young\"\". You don't have to answer any of these questions, I respect privacy. But if you don't mind, how old are you? Finally, you say you're \"\"not a Zionist\"\". That can mean one of two different things. One is that you're simply not a Zionist the same way as I'm simply not a Belgian. I've got nothing against Belgians, I'm just not Belgian. Similarly, you could have just been saying that you're simply not a Zionist. You've got nothing against Zionism, you just simply aren't one. Of course it could also mean something very different. It could mean that you're against Zionism.\n",

I let myself get WAY too angry...to the point where I missed some good points made by others. I really like your idea of using the acronyms for EBV-related pages, but maybe as redirects to written out pages. I've given up on the en dash issue: I found some key lit. (humiliatingly enough from my own lab...in the old days) that sets a good precedent for the en dash (though it is rarely used in modern lit.). The hyphenation stuff is the major point now. I've suggested using the written out names for the main pages and used the ones ones that best fit the accepted EBV gene acronyms (citing relevant papers in PubMed).

Which means that only we bosniaks are bosnians in Bosnia, serbs and croats are strangers. \n",

      "It is ridiculous that all focus is dedicated on how animals select a partner that in 100 kb text we cannot even afford a note on why do they do that in the first place. Ok, male expose higher mutation rate and thus expose higher variability: most of the men are defected whereas others are extremely cute. They can spread they genes as hell and best features can be conserved in women, who undergo much less mutation and exist solely to conserve best genes (best trials, aka best men). This was said in the article, albeit not pronounced clearly. Better exposition of this part would shed some light on why do we have men and women in the first place. It would be even better to say something about recombination. Recombination, aka sexual reproduction or crossover is what allows to combine best features from different individuals. It makes evolution much faster than single individual mutation. Just imagine: one guy fortunately acquires one feature, another guy acquires another feature, third guy acquires some another feature. Now, if they cannot recombine and exchange their knowledge, they have to discover everything themselves. On the other hand, “If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange these apples then you and I will still each have one apple. But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas.” Bernard Shaw explains the recombination principle: The human culture has advanced so rapidly just because you could spread the knowledge for free (I am not talking about climate in Wikipedia). Imagine that you had to discover everything yourself. You would still live in a cave age. So, recombination, sexual reproduction, is extreemly powerful. The flirt affairs sucked around is not as closely crucial. Why cannot we have even a reference to the recombination?\n",

Wikipedia claims to be a online encyclopedia that anyone can edit. If that doesn't include pedophiles, than how is that fair?. If we allow certain sexual minorities to be silenced, what's next?, allowing certain racial minorities to be silenced as well. As a frequent reader and occasional editor of wikipedia, I only want to read factual, neutral POV articles, and I don't care about the race, nationality, ethnicity, sex, or sexual orientation of the editor. Even if most people have moral objections to pedophilia, surely we can agree that we all have a right to post on wikipedia as long as we abide by the rules.\"\"  TAB \n",

Clearly, her legal threats were attention-seeking behavior. Jessica isn't. Apparently Wikipedians like to keep track of her and not Isis. So it would make sense to add her to the list. That way everyone can keep track of her and nobody can say that they don't know. Administrators can block accounts on sight. So if anyone acts like her, they will all be blocked. Including her on the list is vital because some people don't know her specific behaviors and if they have that similar behavior, they will be blocked on sight. Jessica never asked for attention. The Wikipedians gave it to her. So maybe you should ask them why they gave attention to her. Apparently Wikipedia is also mad at her to create an article for her on ED.

      "Aubrey is not considered the the litmus test of accuracy, but his comments are consistently quoted by biographers as accumulative supporting evidence, as it is assumed he had access to primary sources that have since disappeared and/or people who knew the people he wrote of. As with the majority of historical figures there is no direct evidence, but the supporting evidence is significant, and would certainly be considered enough to accuse someone of heterosexuality. In On Friendship and On Beauty Bacon addresses male love, or 'masculine love' as he significantly terms it in New Atlantis. Male love can obviously be platonic, but the term was also employed by the earliest writers who self-identified as what we now term homosexual, so it adds to the supporting evidence. Some of the referenced sources offer a deeper discussion of the context of Bacon's use of term and Elizabethan homosocial writing. It was I who originally referenced Mathews in the article as a scholarly source for the opinion that Bacon wasn't homosexual. In your change you retained Mathews, but deleted the other references I also supplied that show the spectrum of scholarly opinion. How true to type.

I do not want to construct something new, only show that there are two classes in common usage: Clifford ring (my name) and Clifford algebra; furthermore, that some inaccuracy occurs because they are not adequately distinguished.  All I'm saying is that there exists a class of objects (Clifford ring) in which no specific subspace is necessarily known as the generating vector space V.  You can hide the identity of the subspace V (and the grading) by \"\"mysterious relabelling\"\".  But here is the point: this relabelling truly does hide which of the basis vectors span V; it is possible to form a product for every element in the ring, but impossible to identify the original subspace V used in the construction.  The quaternions are a ring isomorphic to Cℓ0,2(ℝ), which has a 1,2,1 grading structure.  Yet, given ℍ, can you find a unique decomposition with this grading structure?  No.  In a CA, grading specifically refers to a unique/natural decomposition into (I think it is into a direct sum of) 0-vectors, 1-vectors, 2-vectors etc.  talkcontr 19:22\"\n",

You may disagree with them, but it is still valid in a Wikipedia article to report what the publisher believes about their own work. I actually agree with much of your evaluation, but in order to keep Wikipedia neutral, our opinions should not be used to decide what to report and what not to report.

However, it is absolutely absurd that the Five Moves are repeatedly removed by some mark-out fanboy who doesn't want anything negative said about Cena. The Five Moves are the basis of almost all criticism aimed at Cena, and therefore I have placed them back on the page, although obviously I have rephrased the wording so it is no longer biased against Cena and is entirely factual. Don't remove them again, as that is just stupid and goes against your whole 'no bias' attitude since you're biasing it in favour of Cena while also not letting people know the truth.

      "I was born and raised a Muslim and I know from personal experience how that term is used to discriminate against people. Though you maybe correct that I have strong POV with this issue. There are many concerns that need to be discussed with the article. We all agree that the original version, the one before the major edits was no good becuase it lacked sources, citations and it had a strong anti-Islamic bias and was strongly POV from the other side. The term is very broadly applied and it is defined differently by diferent people. The prior version of the article focused on degrading Islam. One thing that is not understood by anybody here is that ISLAM IS INHERENTLY A POLITICAL RELIGION. ISLAM IS A RELIGION MEANT TO BE APPLIED TO GOVERNMENTS. Though the term Islamism has been defined by other people and most of you guys are just reflecting on that. This article is still strongly POV from the otherside. Reagrdless, this is a very controversial topic and i think we should start fresh again.\n",

At least you've taken the time to have a civil discussion.  That courtesy is frequently not given.  From another IP address a couple of months ago I wrote an entire article of, I think, very high quality, lengthy, well referenced, comprehensive, etc, etc, and then got blocked after someone reverted something I did with no explanation, and I reverted back.  No-one said a word about the article I wrote - all I got in return was a bunch of snotty templates and a block, for trying to reinstate good work.

      "But this is like saying we had to wait until 2012 so we could post a photograph of J.D. Salinger on his article (btw, they used a Fair-use provision long before that). They are both people who were alive, but are inaccessible to the general public for the foreseeable future. He may or may not (depending on your definiton, or how you believe Kim Jong-Un lives like) be a recluse, but the only images that are made of him come from KCNA. And he isnt going to be giving selfies to his adoring fans anytime soon, or to anyone for that matter, much less to somebody who is willing to release a content of him for Free-Use or CC. So I dont understand how someone can come to the conclusion that the leader of North Korea is a figure who is not in a position inacessible to the genenral public. Are we supposed to wait until Kim Jong Un dies before we can get a fair-use provision? Or are we making conclusions that because somebody might be able to take a photograph of him in an unspecified future timeframe, fair-use is rendered incompatible with any content depicting him. Im not usually involved in license debates, but I seriously think this is already one of the worst world leader articles ive seen in a while and the lack of image is a huge part of it (he is currently the only world leader who is missing an image).\n",

      "I have an issue with the statment \"\"Beckett's work is . . . deeply pessimistic about the human condition\"\" as found in the first paragraph. I changed \"\"deeply\"\" to \"\"deceptively,\"\" and it was immediately changed back. I don't know how to contact the subsequent editor directly, so I'll post this here by way of discussion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps replacing “deeply” with “deceptively” is not the best fix, but as it stands the quoted statement puts forth, as fact, an opinion that is widley open to interpretation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beckett’s writings aren’t just about the journey. If they were, “deeply pessimistic” would be nearly undebatable. They’re just as much about the destination, or at least the goal. And while he frames life’s journey as a slog through shit, his ultimate implication is that the slog is worthwhile. As everything from the Greek and Latin classics to the greatest of Hollywood’s pro-war propaganda movies have proven again and again, the more monstrously you portray the obstacle, the larger looms the hero who overcomes them. The same is true in Beckett: the obstacles are unrelenting and nearly insurmountable, but the journey continues, heroically. The Beckett hero may be standing in the dark, but he's faced towards the light, distant—an unattainable—as it may be.\n",
      "\n",
      "The essential Beckett quote isn’t “I can’t go on”—full stop; it’s “I can’t go on. I’ll go on.”\n",

If some Jws are not happy, why don't they put some 'positive' books in the positive section as a balance? Reducing book descriptions until they are meaningless, or so vague that no one knows what they are about, is a rather surreptitious form of direct censorship, or reader manipulation at the least, and should not be encoraged. We all need to be honest about our motives for \"\"this or that\"\" change to any Wikepedia article.

It is true that the war escalated after the declaration of independence, but it was certainly in existence before Croatia formally declared independence. As for 2) I agree that Yugoslavia could have went on without one or more republics, but the situation on the ground was that four out of six republics declared their independence during the war (events not necessarily linked to the war, but arguably influenced by it) and the Badinter Arbitration Committee said that in November 1991 - January 1992 SFR Yugoslavia dissolved, inter alia, due to Slovenian and Croatian independence votes. As for 3) that means that they did not change when situation before March 1991 and after November 1995 is compared. Of course the borders are the same since 1947 (by demarcation committees, not in 1943) but the first two dates specified are important here. Erdut Agreement and UNSC resolution 1037 define the territory as Croatian, the UN mandate as temporary and define the outcome as transfer to Croatian control. Furthermore expelling forces, civilians or troops leaving a country and UN mandates do not constitute territorial changes and should not be in this field at all.

Before my latest edit, the Shlomo Argov edit did not even make sense - it couldn't, since the latter half of the paragraph that completed the first one was removed and replaced by something unrelated. What's more, all the material inserted by me today - about Israel's casus belli and the UN's commission's finding that Israel was responsible for the massacre - was there before my latest edits and only got removed, possibly by POV-motivated authors, this month. You can see both edits were already there months ago. Both edits are well sourced and, after a cursory look at the editing history, it can be seen whoever removed them did not give an explanation for their actions. The casus belli edit has as a source David Hirst's book about Lebanese history. The book was widely reviewed on mainstream media, and praised. It sits at the top of Wikipedia's reliable source chain. And even though this isn't required, the book is excerpted to show it supports the edit's content. In case anyone's in doubt, several other sources give support to Hirst's narrative.

In my opinion, this will eventually become the most comprehensive and definitive Sweetest Day article anywhere. Contrary to what many may think, I am not anti-Sweetest Day. I simply believe Americans have a right to know the real history of what they are celebrating when it comes to holidays. The Herbert Birch Kingston Story of the origins of Sweetest Day is a verisimilitude, meaning it is very similar to the truth but not the exact truth at all. In fact, the dissemination of this story by Hallmark, American Greetings, Retail Confectioners International and countless other promoters of Sweetest Day is a form of mass deception and market manipulation. It has been going on for 85 years and has resulted in billions of dollars in revenues for these companies. But at what cost? America pays the cost of Sweetest Day in credibility, a trend which must be reversed if we are ever to win the hearts and minds of the world again. \n",

Your edit and addition were valid and correct, and arguably warranted, and I would never revert what you put it, because it happens to be referenced and sourced and what's stated by majority scholarship on this issue.   So it was a valid modification and elaboration etc.  To what I put in, that was also sourced.  As WP policy recommends, \"\"modify instead of wholesale deletion\"\", to improve not remove.   And again, the point of Wilson and Cahill was in the context of the very section and paragraphs themselves, of rationalizing or explaining why Egypt herself never chronicalized things like the  10 plagues or the Hebrew exodus out of Egyptian slavery etc, or the destruction of Egyptian charioteers and soldiers or of that then reigning king of Egypt.   Of course majority historians discount it ever actually happening, but it's also known and admitted (as a general point) that ancient pagan nations or kingdoms in general would not always be so honest or straightforward or complete in their recording of everything.   Embellishing some facts and details, while minimizing or even totally hiding others.   And that was really the point.   Anyway, thanks for your work on it too.

I furthermore understand that a point at the intersection of more than 3 sphere surfaces is clearly at the intersection of 3 sphere surfaces.  Are you able to comprehend these facts, siafu?    \n",

I also disputed the use of the term \"\"sharing,\"\" which is a misnomer. Sharing is a computer concept whereby a network of computers share access so that computer A can access a file on computer B, but the file remains resident on computer B. Copying is a simple concept whereby the file on computer B is copied to computer B. Napster was designed to facilitate copying, but the proponents of Napster called it \"\"sharing\"\" for propaganda purposes, since the unauthorized copying of a copyrighted work is a civil and criminal offense and morally wrong. \"\"Sharing\"\" sounds like something your elementary school teacher wanted you to do. If you share a sandwich, the other person eats half of your sandwich. If you log onto a so-called \"\"file-sharing\"\" system, the other person copies your song, but you keep your copy, too. The Courts held that Napster was a giant copyright infringement. However, it was very popular and still has many proponents on Widipedia, who still insist on calling it \"\"sharing\"\" and don't want the fact that their \"\"sharing\"\" wiped out the music industry (and a lot of recording arists with it), because that makes them immoral people.

Here is the joke: Mark Fuhrman, with his LAPD police badge and his gun, with all of those yummmy bullets in it, would do traffic stops on black people.  If you think that was a DWB kind of thing, well, other might feel that way too... Anyway the joke is this:  He did not love those niggers that stopped, he loved the effect that using, under color of authority (pun intended), the WORD nigger has on them emotionally.  See, if he could just get an emotional repsonse from those niggers, he might be able to create an excuse in order to insert some of those yummy bullets into them.  Mostly, those niggers just sat and and took it.  Some non-admin Wikipedians find themselves in the same situation as those guys. Ironically, Mark probably makes a lot more money with his books now than he ever did as a policeman.  Provided that people merely purchase and read his books, but do not actually take them seriously, maybe we are all better off that way. He's got more money.  He does not use the n-word anymore.  He does not carry a gun and use the n-word under color of authority.  Surely, that is best of all possible worlds, is it not?\n",
