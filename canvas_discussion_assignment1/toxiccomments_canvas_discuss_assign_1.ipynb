At least some of you German speakers have to realize that by moving the Province of Bolzano-Bozen to just South Tyrol on English Wikipedia is just emphasizing a German point of view, and only a German point of view.  You really can not say that South Tyrol is the major English usage.  It just isn't.  Alto Adige is also used very often, in the Unites States, almost entirely.  The name of the page itself is taken from Brittanica.  Even on the Bolzano provincial website, one of the English documents says Province of Bolzano.  Look, you guys can do anything you want.  If you change it to South Tyrol, I hope it really makes all of you finally happy with your lives.

The fact that it used to be single party government is largely an irrelvance; the important thing is that it is still a constitutional monarchy, parliamentary system, that allows for both coalitions and majority rule. That hasn't changed, and so to say that because we currently have a coalition, of whatever party, means that the position of Deputy Prime Minister should be included alongside the heads of state and government is false. I am all for mentioning Nick Clegg as Deputy Prime Minister in the article, around the same place David Cameron is currently described as Prime Minister, but to put Clegg alongside the Queen and Prime Minister on the basis of it being a coalition government is not right. Now if the job were constitutionally defined as being the Prime Minister's second-in-command, and if Cameron were to die/resign suddenly Clegg would become Prime Minister, I would completely agree that he should be there, but it isn't. Clegg may be Deputy Prime Minister, but he is not deputy head of government, and so he should not be put alongside the head of state and head of government.\n",

His account claims that Martin was directly over him when he shot him.  Yet a 9mm hollow point wound in Martin's front chest would be expected to shower blood all over Zimmerman.  This evidence clearly contradicts Zimmerman's account.  Another report indicates that the shot was fired from more than 18 inches away.  This contrary evidence and contradiction in Zimmerman's story should be noted in this wiki article.  Speculation is that Zimmerman achieved standing (off the ground from a lying down position) status after Martin's struggled with him and then shot him with his 9mm as payback for the beating upon himself which he had apparently initiated.  By leaving these facts out of the article it suggests that wiki authors are suspedning the laws of gravity and common sense.  BTW, who locked the article down from further editing?

It is an advanced science, that is even beyond our most advanced physics we use today. It is beyond a fusion reactor. When someone 'gifts' with you advanced knowledge of the universe, you accept it, and use it to better yourself. That was David Hamel's goal for the last 30 years. He was contacted in 1975. I have tried to tell people about this stuff for years. The physics work closely to the principles of nature. This is a benefit to all people of this world.

(Perhaps it should read, \"\"a former member of the Ku Klux Klan.\"\")  Furthermore, Duke was in the Klan in the 1970's, nearly three decades before The Political Cesspool first went on the air.

My problem with this is that it is not a, um, well known publication, and as such would not likely be reviewed by any newspapers or such. Is there anything I can do (or in other words, what kind of external sources do I need?) to get my article back on Wikipedia? How can I get somebody that you define as reliable to verify that Westside, umm, exists? It just doesn't seem fair that I can't write an article about Westside just because the New York Times doesn't write about it. I thought the purpose of Wikipedia was to make information available to anyone who wants it. Several of Westside's readers have approached Wyatt (the co-creator) about a website to learn more about it, and, as of yet, he has no website to point them to. When he asked me to create a site about it (he's not great with these things) I of course immediately thought \"\"What better than Wikipedia?\"\" Unfortunately, I wasn't aware of the difficulty of putting a simple article up on Wikipedia. I won't deny that this has made me very angry. Is there ANY way for me to get my article back up? There's pretty much no chance that anything like a newspaper will cite Westside. Is there some kind of other source that I can get to review Westside? Also, why was my article initially cited as an attack article? It seemed obvious to me that my description of Tucker and Jason were not in any way insulting, as their apparent lack of intelligence is a character trait. Thanks in advance for your response.\"\n",

      "Well there's been a lot said, if I can just address Kolzene's point first. I don't quite understand your suggestion that the article needs to be split into 3 different ones, what would these different articles be? Firstly let's just overview what is already in place, we've got this article: Technocratic movement (and the sub-articles like Technate, etc.), we've got Technocracy (which is just a disambiguation page), Technocracy (bureaucratic) and Technocrat (derogatory). Then we have Network of European Technocrats, which is part of the broader Technocratic movement. So what you're saying is we need a Technocracy Incorporated article, specifically about that group, detached from the main article in the same way as NET? Well, I suppose that could be done, but remember that that article did already once exist and was then merged with this one. What would this article contain if all the Tech Inc. stuff were taken out and put in a different article? I have to say, I think further splitting of the articles will only create an even more confusing array of definitions for readers. Perhaps we should think about reformatting the above articles into a more reasonable arrangement. The article Technocracy used to be a lot bigger and gave more info on the different groups and definitions of the term, but it was recently trimmed down to something very small, (which I was against doing BTW). So to start from the beginning, we have the word Technocracy, which has acquired many different meanings, one meaning being a Bureaucratic oligarchy of Scientists, this is addressed in the Technocracy (bureaucratic) and Technocrat (derogatory) articles and isn't really relevant here. The other meaning, the one we are concerned with here is that used by the Technical Alliance and Tech Inc. and subsequently adopted by several other groups in 1930's. Then NET, which was essentially a direct branching from Tech Inc., just in Europe, but has adopted it's own ideas, some of which are different to Tech Inc's. I don't really know what is the best way to proceed yet, but I don't think anything should be split or deleted without a lot more discussion.\n",

      "So a third pornography industry advocate has joined this correspondence, which increases the number of participants but actually decreases its importance in my affairs, as well as the relevance of Wikipedia in important matters regarding the health of our society (it is lamentably our society... I only wish I could call it your society).  But I may call Wikipedia your propaganda tool, since you are apparently the one who has been granted authority to tolerate certain comments which you interpret as being unbiased and to crassly delete other information which you interpret as being biased.  If you really want to avoid bias, just casually investigate the history of your pornography supporting friend Horrorshow, who, not surprisingly, has been busy editing other articles that clearly promote the pornography industry.  Wikipedia: a free speech tool for the people or a propaganda tool for a certain sector of the population which seeks to control people's opinions on matters that adversely affect their mental health?  Quite a question to ponder.  But my point on bias is that every author is biased.  Just because Wikipedia can be edited by supposedly anybody (in theory it can be, but in reality it is clearly controlled by certain well-organized individuals who have made Wikipediaing their vocations), does not make Wikipedia an unbiased source of information.  The author of this webpage, who clearly has an interest in displaying information that promotes the pornography industry in the United States, is biased.  His or her comments on Lubben's religious views clearly betray that sentiment, as do the history of his or her activities on Wikipedia.  And you don't need to tolerate anything from me any longer, because I will stop now... or maybe I won't, I guess it depends on just how much time I'm willing to waste communicating with you.  This is becoming Dostoevskian, Underground Man... give it a read sometime... it might help you.Veritas, Semper .  But you and I both know where the truth lies in this matter.  There is no need for an arbitrator, who, again, would be mistakenly be labeled an unbiased third party.\n",

      "I'm going on the soapbox for awhile, an uncomfortable position in a baseball game (sliding runners tend to knock it out from under you).  I want to explain my position without us getting personal.  If you take offense, apologies in advance.  And apologies for being so wordy.  Genetic defect.\n",

      "I am a baseball researcher by hobby (computer programmer by trade), and I take everything about baseball's history seriously, especially the Negro Leagues, which have become my area of expertise.  Segregation in Baseball remains the absolute worst scar on its face.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my opinion (emphasis on it being my opinion), Josh Gibson, Pete Hill, Satchel Paige, Bullet Rogan, Oscar Charleston, Andy Cooper, José Méndez, Cristobal Torrienté, and many others men would have easily been Hall of Famers long, long ago had it not been for segregation.  It's my belief that given current evidence Gibson wouldn't have hit much more than 500 or so home runs playing a full schedule, given the HR rates of the 30s and 40s (not nearly as high as today), given his truncated career (he died after his 17th season), and given the position he played (catchers just don't play full schedules because of the extreme wear and tear; on the other hand, he might have been converted into an outfielder or first baseman in an integrated Majors, and 600+ would have been a possibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Babe Ruth hit 714 Major League HRs; had he had to face Bullet Rogan, Andy Cooper, Satchel Paige, and other pitchers of color, his totals might have tailed down toward 650 or so, and that in a 22-year career compared to Gibson's 17.\n",
      "\n",
      "What we know is that Gibson is credited with 115 verifiable HR in Negro League play, plus 44 in Mexican League play, which was a bit lower level competition than MLB.  Gibson hit .359 against Negro League competition, which would be second highest of all time (behind Cobb) had he done so in an integrated majors, and Cobb's .366 might have lost a few points as well had he had to face Negro pitchers like Lefty Cooper and Willie Foster.\n",
      "\n",
      "The raw numbers are still small.  We can't do anything about that.  115 compares very badly to 714, much less 762.  But it's still important to know those numbers, because it's what he did against major league-level competition.  What he did against amateur and semi-pro competition in exhibition games is fun to know (if we truly did know), but it is not the true measure of his worth, and (IMO) it insults the man's memory to artificially pad his numbers.  Understanding that Babe Ruth hit HIS home runs in a league that played 154 games per season, that homers were easier to hit in Ruth's league than Gibson's (livelier baseballs in the AL), the relative numbers make Gibson look like Ruth's peer.\n",
      "\n",
      "With few exceptions, there are no researchers who do not believe that Josh Gibson was one of the two or three best pure power hitters in the game, and no exceptions among serious Negro League researchers.  We can (and in fact should) report that there have been various reports of his accomplishments in earlier days, but these numbers, taken without any context present a superman as unbelievable as that X-Files episode (\"\"The Unnatural\"\").\n",
      "\n",
      "You have to trust that the reason for putting up Gibson's reduced stats has a noble purpose.  Telling people that Gibson hit 800+ HR and batted .384 against all levels of competition tells nothing really, because he could have in reality hit .200 with no HR against top-level Negro League teams, but fattened up by counting 1,000 games against Little League comptetition.  Telling them he hit .359 and had a home run every sixteen at bats in a career that included many games in Griffith Stadium tells them something of importance  it gives us an excellent clue as to how he would have hit in the Majors, had he been allowed to play.\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"\"nearly 800\"\" and \"\"962\"\" numbers give us no way of being able to separate them and understand their meaning.  An official scorer counted every one of Babe Ruth's HR in his major league career, and we can go back to sources from that day and find it.  In Gibson's case, someone reported (sometimes months later) numbers that no one even at that time could verify, because a lot of the numbers were based on hearsay, and some were just plain made-up.  We can't tell how many he hit over a 150-foot fence against a 17-year-old kid with a 60 MPH fastball, because we can't separate them.\n",

Seeing that there is no cite that I have seen confirming this, and, just as well, the first sentence of the article notes that the being is \"\"unidentified,\"\" I personally don't see why this article is named such. Shouldn't the article's title be changed? I think it should be called \"\"Cloverfield Monster,\"\" without the parenthesis. Is this fact... \n",

Nither of those are particularly good, either.  The problem is that given that the thing doesn't appear to have any proper name, there's really no perfect place for the article to go right now.  Using a generic noun with (Cloverfield) after it seems to have the appropriate vagueness.  The producers tend to refer to it as 'creature', but most third-party sources are calling it a 'monster.'  We may as well flip a coin, really.  \n",

It seems the general concensous is, no it isn't an ideal title, but since we have nothing better, there isn't sufficient motivation to move it.  \"\"Cloverfield monster\"\" is certainly a likely candidate, but without an extremely reliable source, such as an official designation from the creative property holder, we may as well leave it where it is until such a source comes into existence.  A sequel looks rather undoubtable, and I should think chances are pretty good it will get a name within the fictional universe then. -  \n",

For one thing, there are two \"\"creatures\"\" in cloverfield, the main creature, and the parasites, both of which are discussed in this article.  For another thing, it sounds too official.  \"\"The Cloverfield creature\"\" is not it's official name either.  I think it is much better to just leave it as Cloverfield_(creature) and wait for more sources.  Eventually the creature will get a name, and at that point the page will just have to move again, so I'd like to see a stronger argument for why your name choice, or any other, is optimal and signifigantly better than it's original name. -[[Use\n",

      "The addition of \"\"and\"\" is good. However, a force need not be \"\"perceived\"\" to exist. The definition of \"\"acceleration\"\" is indeed confusing to the lay person, but I think that the wikilink on acceleration covers it. We need to be careful to not go overboard in description in the lead.\n",

Again, the wikilink I think should suffice, but maybe we can reword things without providing definitions to make it clearer. I want this to be intelligible, but I'm afraid that including these points might be confusing for many and an annoyance to even more.\n",
      "Following the development of quantum mechanics, it is now understood that momentum is a fundamental property of particles and that, according to the standard model of particle physics, changes in momentum are the consequence of the net emission or absorption by particles of momentum-carrying gauge bosons. Effects which are at the macro level experienced as a \"\"force\"\" are the consequence of the aggregate effect of these boson-mediated fundamental interactions. In modern physics, only four fundamental interactions are known; in order of decreasing strength, they are: strong, electromagnetic, weak, and gravitational.[1] High-energy particle physics observations in 1970s and 1980s confirmed that the weak and electromagnetic forces are expressions of a unified electroweak interaction. No gauge boson has yet been demonstrated for mediating the gravitational interaction and what is perceived as the \"\"force\"\" of gravity is more accurately attributable to the the effect of distortions by massive bodies of the curvature of spacetime as explicated in Einstein's Theory of General Relativity.\n",
      "There is a slight issue here with the sentence: \"\"Effects which are at the macro level experienced as a \"\"force\"\" are the consequence of the aggregate effect of these boson-mediated fundamental interactions.\"\" This sentence misses the fact that forces also exist on the micro level. A single boson-mediated fundamental interaction often has a \"\"force\"\" associated with it. For example, an electron accelerates because it emits a photon: this is due to the electromagnetic force acting on the electron. One micro-interaction: still a force since a mass accelerated.\n",

Obviously both Kerry and Gore had shortcomings as flag-waver in chief for the Democratic platform. On the other hand, I don't find Newt Gingrich or George Bush to be particularly compelling orators either. (Although Newt can be very interesting to listen to in smaller venues, particularly since he left office). And yet both had a high degree of political success - until Bush foundered when the Iraq war turned into a disaster. This goes back to my original point - the policy basis for both parties is more or less the same now as it has been since '92, because at their core the parties are have hardly changed. All that has been altered are details of communication and appeal. The idea that significant change is coming in either party has regularly proven to be untrue - losing elections has not seemed to presage major change. You could argue that Internet politicking has had a much more significant impact. Anyway, sorry I'm being somewhat unclear - in a rush, out the door!   T   \"\n",

The newsreporting to me sounds kind of biased in making it seem like the deck was stacked against Bell in that regard when in truth in a community that small it would have been almost impossible not to draw some connection within 1 or 2 degrees of seperation. I honestly do believe some of the events were biased against Bell (particularly charging him as an adult when the law clearly said that could not be done and the releveant factors the DA considered weren't considered relevant in prior LA SC decisions), but I think their is a reason you're not seeing that fact harped on... even the pro-Bell supporters realise it's probably more fluke then noteworthy. It just looks to me like people trying to make a statistic look like a fact, when if you put it into a broader picture, it's nothing signifigant. I'd wager on most jurys in the Parish, white or black criminal, one of the jurors can be traced in some way back to the victim, and I doubt at MOST you'd need even a 3 people seperation to link it.

There are space tethers in orbit right this very minute that are made with existing materials.  Even the Boeing report that you have quoted says they are possible with existing materials.  Is there an upper limit to the length that a practical space tether can be built with existing materials?  Yes there is.  The overall upper length limit for a non-rotating skyhook that is still economically worthwhile is probably around 5,000 km.  To the best of my knowledge no one has gone to the trouble of actually determining that upper limit simply because by the time we build one that long there will be better materials that will allow us to build an even longer one.\n",

It is all a matter of degree.  \n",

      "With current materials we can build a non-rotating skyhook up to about 5,000 km in length if we push it.  But we don't need to build one that long to make affordable space flight a reality.  A 2,200 km long non-rotating skyhook will have a lower endpoint velocity of 80% of orbital velocity for that altitude, and an upper endpoint velocity of 91% of escape velocity for its altitude.  Such a skyhook combined with a reusable single stage sub-orbital launch vehicle and the Orion spacecraft would give us affordable access to Earth orbit and all of near Earth space.  Space tourism, asteroid mining, satellite solar power stations, and space colonies would all become possible with such a system.\n",

Standfordham wrote to the King, on 7 October, 'I saw Mr Baldwin who, in reply to my question \"\"Do you want to turn the Government out?\"\" said \"\"Yes, but not on the Campbell issue, but on the Russian Treaties which the country generally condemns.\"\" He sees no alternative to a dissolution; it has always been expected, some wished for it before now, though he is opposed to hastening the Government's fall. ...' ... And it is true that only in the House of Commons were Baldwin's strictures based on the Campbell case – at Newcastle on 2 October he congratulated MacDonald on the agreement, achieved at a conference in London, on the Dawes Plan for reparations, and then spent the rest of the speech alternately pouring scorn on the Labour party's subservience to its extremists, and tearing to pieces the Russian agreement. But the final debate on 8 October was a mean Parliamentary occasion. Two days before, in a meeting which was something of a suave qui puet, the Cabinet decided to take it as a vote of confidence, preferring to go out on the Campbell case to a defeat on the Russian Treaties which might give the left wing too much prominence.—Middlemas and Barnes, p. 273.  \"\n",

Now, I'll certainly grant that whether his films are propaganda depends on your definition of propaganda, but my concern is that the category is not being used in a consistent fashion, and these inconsistencies can give the appearance of bias. As such, I think clearer criteria for inclusion in the category would help eliminate these inconsistencies, so I've put up a proposal at Category talk:Propaganda films. As someone who's been involved in this issue, I thought you might want to weigh in.\n",

      "First of all the Kurdish flag is allowed in Iran, but is not sanctioned publicly. Kurds have it in their homes and are allowed to have them. It is certainly not criminal in Iran for Kurds to have the Kurdish flag or symbol as many of my friends do. So edit your statement about it being criminal in Iran. Need I remind you all, that Kurds are ethnic Iranians and have historically enjoyed the greatest liberties in Iran as opposed to the mainstream discrimination Kurds face in Syria, Iraq, and Turkey?  \n",
      "It is usually Israeli sources, with increasing American and British help and aid, that intentionally falsely claim that the Kurdish flag (which fly the Pan-Iranian colours as does the unofficial flag of the Azerbaijani people and the flag of Tajikistan) is prohibited in Iran. FLYING THE KURDISH FLAG IN IRAN IS NOT CRIMINAL AS IT IS MENTIONED BY ISRAELI SOURCES. \n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, I go on to read that there was research done that basically proves Kurds and Jews are genetically the same. It seems to me that certain individuals who I can see are Israeli are following the Israeli states policy of editing articles in lines with current events in the Middle East. Kurds are Iranians just as how Russians, Serbs, Poles, and Bulgarians are all Slavic peoples. Israel, the USA, and Britain are trying to create conflict in Iran as was done in the former Yugoslavia by creating problems along ethnic lines. This is called ‘balkanisation.’ The Israelis are doing this covertly through operations in Iraqi Kurdistan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Propaganda for dividing and conquering people starts with definitions then the manipulation of history. I am an academic in the fields of anthropology and history and an Iranian from a minority group that is neither Persian nor Kurdish. I can tell you that Kurds are definitely ethnic Iranians in all senses from tradition to language, history, culture, identity, and genetics. I am alarmed by the current purging of internet articles that have hidden agendas trying to separate the Iranian identity of Kurds. \n",
      "\n",
      "As I was told by a Kurdish professor, Mr. Eskandari in Tehran: “Kurds are Iranian and the entity of Iran as a state and nation was founded by the [main] ancestors of the Kurds, the Mede who established Iran as an empire. One problem that has compounded the issue is that people misuse the term Persian and Iranian. Persians are Iranian, but all Iranians, like the Kurds and Ossetians, are not Persians.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mede and other similar Iranian groups are the ancestors of the Kurds, but not the only group, just like how the ancient Persians are the main ancestors of the modern Persians, but not the only ancestors. Ancestors of Persians and Kurds also include Arabs, Mongols, and other Iranian peoples. \n",
      "\n",
      "I ask all the honest people on this site who wish to enhance knowledge not to take part in this fabrication of fact. There was a time when the Turkish government tried to convince Kurds that they were “Mountain Turks” and now there are powers at play that are either trying to disassociate the Kurds from their Iranian identity and origins or make whole generations of proud young Kurds forget or be unaware of their Iranian ethnicity. This is due to geo-strategic schemes. These forces are trying to victimize a whole group of people from knowing their own proud history and culture which is genuinely Iranian. The covert foreign policy of Israel, Britain, and America comes at the expense of the Kurds and even their history and culture.\n",

      "Sometime in 2002, I created an account on wikipedia to see if I can meet the demands of the clients who request for wiki job on freelance platforms. To be frank, I didn't understand how to use wikipedia as at then. Hence, I abandoned the urge to write wikipedia articles and continued with my normal web content development and article writing career.\n",
      "\n",

      "I made a decision to learn about wikipedia writing and what it entails. I started reading all the wiki tutorials I could see on wikipedia.  I started learning and indeed, it's quite interesting.  It was not easy initially, but, I vowed to know more.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I placed my first bid  on freelancer.com. A client wanted me to write on \"\"Joshua Letcher\"\" . I accepted. I used this particular topic to learn some facts about wiki policies.  I created and submitted it for review. It was rejected but I was told what to do to make it acceptable. I took some days to make some researches about \"\"Joshua Letcher\"\" I discovered, there are no media secondary resources.. That was the reason the article was deleted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the same client also contracted me to write about thier company \"\"Newfield Resources Ltd. I did my research to get some secondary resources. I succeeded and created the article. It was allowed to stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I got excited. I really became very happy that I can now write wikipedia articles. So, I went for more.  I always focused more on maintaining neutrality and using secondary sources. I also follow the rules on referencing and formatting having taken enough time to learn them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, as a freelancer, I kept getting alerts about new Wikipedia  creation jobs. I  go ahead to place my bids.  I really got selected by some clients to help them put up a wikipedia page.  I also get paid for doing so as a freelancer. I turn down jobs that do not have media coverage or jobs that are meant to promote or advertise since they are against wiki rules.\n",

That being said, WP is not an anarchy.  There are rules that everyone is expected to abide by in order to keep things running smoothly.  I think you can appreciate that.  That being said, Aeon1006 wrote that he left the AMA so that he could join the mediation cabral, not because he had butchered his job as advocate.  If he had just acknowledged that he had been a poor advocate and that he was resigning because he was not capable of being a good one, then that would have been okay for everyone.  Even the ADMIN who decided to block me agreed that my allegations that Aeon1006 seriously breached his duty as an advocate were probably true.  YOu talk about bad faith?  Aeon1006 \"\"pretending\"\" to help I-B and immediately soliciting testimonies from users against his client, and later turning around to help I-B's opposing parties  now THAT is BAD FAITH.  I am all for working together and making efforts to compromise, so long as it is done with reasonable people who are respectful.

      " LOL! I am not sure anybody wants to get involved in that one. The topic banned editor [User:Andreasgde] came up with a temp. solution of avoiding the usage of \"\"The/the Beatles\"\" midsentence and that apparently resolved most of the issue since 2011, until I stumbled into it and asked too many questions before somebody gave me some links and kicks. It would seem the hundreds of articles concerning The Beatles group, the Beatles members, albums, and compositions, use the syntax I just used.  [User:GabeMC] wants to  start changing all ocurrences to \"\"the Beatles\"\" mid sentence with his Straw Poll. When editors disagree he gets nasty with ridicule, argumentative and posts snipes on user talk pages. His argument is that each article can ignore WP:MOSTM on it's own consensus and only war in two or three articles, so far, on this issue. Trouble is there is no consistency in trademark usage, old documents, WP:MOS vs. WP:MOSTM, English grammar, or editor ideas that prevails with capitals or not. My concept appears to prevail in a few dozen articlesI have read. The issue has never been resolved due to behavioural issues induced into every discussion and a lack of Arbitated Policy continues the randon edits. Even it my mentioned method succeeds think of the rogue editor seeing this, \"\"When all the Beatles played together The Beatles made good music.\"\" I am only concerned with the unaddressed behaviour of this and a few other editors in these discussions. Nobody seems to want to take them on. Some agreed that a \"\"shot across the bow\"\" may be in order. Funny thing; all of the editors agree an arbitrated decision is needed but won't muzzle themselves long enough to draw serious attention. The mud slinging is unbeliveable and admins have told them to \"\"grow the fuck up\"\" and other less rude demands. It would seem all five or six GabeMc supporters consistently spell Andreasegde's name incorrectly despite a dozen corrections I have witnessed. That and the behaviour technique seem too coincidental, to me. Man, I hate this stuff! I just can't believe this is happening on WP with all these rules and tough nuts. ) 99.251.125.65  \"\n",

      "Hi, I presume your request is related to my assessment of the article for the heraldry and vexillology wikiproject. My reasoning was basically that it was too long to be a stub, and didn't have GA status, which meant it had to be either Start or B class; since it was on the short side I went for Start. Having read it once again I can't immediately think of any content which could be added. This is a problem I have with all coat of arms articles; once you've said what it looks like, when it was first used, who designed it and any possible symbolism, there's really not much else you can say unless the arms are old enough that you can trace the historical development. Having said that, it would possibly be interesting to know why the state has both a seal and a coat of arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would however take issue with your statement Vermont is the only U.S. state to have authentic armorial bearings described in a blazon. First, what do you mean by an authentic coat of arms? Are there states which use fake coats of arms? Also given that the arms are an example of landscape heraldry you might find people arguing whether they are actually 'authentic' arms. Secondly, a blazon is just a written description of a coat of arms; given a picture of a coat of arms someone sufficiently experienced in heraldry can produce a blazon, so there's nothing particularly unique about a coat of arms having a blazon. (In the European tradition it is in fact the blazon that defines the arms rather than the visual representation). Thirdly, if you want to get picky, blazon usually refers to the anglo-french jargon used to describe coats of arms, whereas the blazon of the CoA of Vermont is more like a layman's description, although it does throw in a few heraldic terms (I note that the external link you provide refers to the blazon as 'quasi-heraldic terminology'). Finally Vermont is not the only state which has a blazon enshrined in statute, see Coat of arms of North Dakota for example.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding possible improvements, I would be inclined to add subheadings, e.g. history, blazon,Vermonter's badge. Also, now that you've added a couple of other sources it would probably be good to add citations to indicate which facts come from which source. The external link says that the arms were not defined by statute until 1862, but the article says differently; is the external site wrong? Quoting the statute numbers could possibly be useful. A couple more images could also be good, e.g. of the arms being used today, or historical versions showing the 'considerable liberties taken'.\n",

Andrea James is another transsexual who thinks because she can hide her past life she can make up any all all of her credentials with the thought or fear that no one challenge the validity of them. So you will know if I was graduate of the University of Chicago I would have my diploma displayed on my website with my transcripts if some called my education a grand hoax. Ultimately Ms. James steadfastly refuses to prove that she is a graduate from the University Of Chicago and if she makes up lies of that nature than what can be true about any thing else she claims to have achieved?

In a way you have to feel sorry for her, however you cannot forgive her crimes against her sisters and the community she claims to represent when she thinks nothing about harming a hard working professionals reputation.

      "====I agree. The explanation given by the OP makes no sense. I have sailed these waters many, many times. If you are off \"\"Kanagawa\"\" in Sagami Bay, then Fuji San is to the northwest and Edo (Tokyo) is the to north northeast. The boats are moving to the southeast towards the coast of the Izu peninsula. Because of Fuji San's height above sea level and the reflectivity of snow you do not have to be due east of the mountain to observe a spectacular sun rise. Further confusing the issue, the \"\"Kanagawa\"\" in the title of the print does not refer to Kanagawa Prefecture. Kanagawa Prefecture was established in 1876. Prior to that time, the easternmost part of what is now Kanagawa Prefecture was known as the Province of  Musashi. The westernmost part was known as the province of Sagami. The title may refer to an area in Musashi Province near what is now the city of Yokohama. The problem with this is that you do not see waves of this size in the confined waters of Tokyo Bay. You are only going to see them in Sagami Bay which is consistent with the geography in the print. Perhaps Hokusai was exercising artistic license or perhaps he was reinterpreting something he had heard or been told. Or perhaps he chose the name because it was more recognizable than some of the other locations he might have used.  \"\n",

You can't say anything with this user hogging these articles without him, it is a constant cat dog game here. I am reading a lot of discussions and I have Googled \"\"AI009\"\" , this guy thinks he is God here. The content is according to him, he is making his statements that I certaintly cannot understand why but I am seeing an anti Russian member here who is taking the positon to use this Superpower articles about who he thinks everything should be. Ok, I don't agree with this person and I think he should be banned where  should be in college studying instead of discriminating Russia or whatever message your trying to imput here because this is ridiculious people don't have a right to discuss anything here when user thinks he a cop above the law. I see other users also fustrated with user AI009 and I think this is turning into too much falsehood that no one can trust the content on Wikipedia on these issues. Oh know, whats the point here when we have an 18 year old kid who is making this his website.  Get off, do something else, write a book or something if you want to speak or say something anti Russian because you are doing what is not the best interest of anything here, you making this a cartoon not an information source and I don't like it.\"\n",

The reason ? High military casualties figure speaks of Serbian military incompetence (as contrasted to their self-image of a Ramboid nation); also, it is a sign of heavy Yugoslav involvement in agression on Croatia. Anyone's national sensibilities aside-it is clear that all realiable and available sources put the Serbian military death toll at the lowest level of 8.000.  \n",

      "\n",
      "Even in that link you could not see that anyone from serbian side states something like 10.000.\n",
      "According to Serbian sources regarding the number of Serbian soldiers who died or went missing during all the wars in Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, the number often mentioned is 2,300., and most of them, around a half, are believed to have died in the battle for Vukovar. The cited article states also that \"\"most experts agree with the figure\"\". \n",
      "There are no reason to put 8.000 or 10.000 as official data. These data are contraversial. \n",
      "Croatian sources, ie. general Anton Tus, put the Serbian military casualties figure around 10.000. Other sources, like brigadier general Mile Dedaković, in his book \"\"Bitka za Vukovar\"\", put the highest limit around 12.000. Therefore, chief Croatian estimates revolve around 10 k Serbian military casualties. This page is not about what Serbian sources say-exclusively. Without going into details of questionable veracity of Serbian sources re this battle, the most correct approach is to state what both sides have to say. And, in the cited article by a journalist named Sikavica, it is clear for anyone who is not deaf, blind and mute that some Serbian military figures agree with general Tus's estimates. It is explicit.

Even if they reliably did good work, their output is not directly relevant to \"\"how is this disease treated?\"\". I think we forget that is the primary question. The \"\"why is this treatment recommended?\"\" is a secondary question which ultimately leads to the \"\"what evidence is there that it is effective/safe?\"\", along with \"\"is it available in my country?\"\" and \"\"what are the side effects?\"\", etc, etc. But sadly it seems WP medical articles are not written by people asking reader-questions in order to guide what to say. They are written by non-experts surveying the handy output of PubMed and collating a bunch of factoids they don't fully understand.

      "To be brutally honest, I didn't start with the intention of arguing it from a policy, short of the fact that the OP identified a POV issue with it.  My core argument is on the best organization of information on WP, which is something that policy is very loose on (the closest things being WP:N, WP:SIZE, and WP:SS/WP:SPINOUT).  Single articles covering several similar topics that may or may not be notable in a comparative fashion is better than having short or stub-like individual articles, while still allowing them to be searchable terms - but that's a point I argue without any policy to affirm or deny that approach, it's just a better practice for organization.   As soon as any arguments that used policy to back it up, I can't run on this argument alone and have to point out that our policies generally point in this direction but never spell it out, and that protracts the conversation when others say \"\"well, policy doesn't say that, therefore we don't have to do it.\"\"  Add to the fact that it was a contentious topic, which is going to raise people's attitudes whenever even something close to \"\"Delete\"\" is mentioned, and they will fight tooth and nail, and alter the tone of the discussion.

      "He’s one of journalism’s most beloved and respected men, but someone appears to have it in for Tom Brokaw. \n",
      "Look up the former NBC News anchor on Wikipedia and you’ll find a review of his Emmy-winning reports, his best-selling books, his 20 honorary degrees. Until recently, you also would have found this sentence: \n",
      "“He had been married to Meredith Lynn Auld (a former Miss South Dakota and author) from 1962 until 2007, when an alleged affair between Brokaw and Diane Sawyer ended their marriage.”\n",
      "The Brokaws’ marriage is very much intact (a Google image search shows them arm in arm at events throughout 2008 and 2009). Likewise, ABC News’ Sawyer remains happily married to director Mike Nichols.\n",
      "A rep for Brokaw said he “burst out laughing” when he heard about the supposed affair. Contacted in the arctic reaches of Finland, Sawyer sent back word through her rep that, “as cute as Tom is, she laughed so hard she nearly fell off the icebreaker she’s traveling on.”\n",
      "The purported affair, anonymously added to Brokaw’s bio on Feb. 27, was deleted after five days. Wikipedia Foundation spokesman Jay Walsh tells us the post “would constitute a ‘vandal edit’” but doubted the vandal could be found.\n",
      "“It’s an open system,” says Walsh. “People may use it to exert their views. But the biographies of living people are most scrutinized by our volunteer editors. It’s incumbent on the Wikipedia Foundation to make sure they’re accurate.”\n",
      "Walsh surmised that “someone with some agenda” was behind the post. Or maybe there’s more than one person. Clicking on the discussion page of Brokaw’s bio reveals attempts to slip in digs about his accent and personality. Wiki watchdogs rejected the insults, though not the unflattering picture of the newsman, which reminded one reader of “Clint Eastwood saying, ‘Do you feel lucky, punk?’ ”\n",
      "The effort to smear Brokaw recalls the anonymous Wiki attack in 2005 on former assistant attorney general John Seigenthaler Sr., who, it was falsely claimed, masterminded the assassinations of both John and Bobby Kennedy.\n",
      "Brokaw isn’t the only newsman targeted by Wiki vandals. “Some of our correspondents have stalkers who constantly post falsehoods,” says a source at another network news department. “We’ve had Wikipedia block posts from repeat offenders.”\n",
      "But the unflappable Brokaw isn’t calling for any investigations. Through his rep he said, “This is beneath comment.”\n",

To be an ethnic group a group does not have to have an actual common descent, only the belief in a common descent. There's also the meaning of descent, in anthropology descent does not by necessity have have to have a biological reality, some ethnic groups claim a common descent from gods, or totems. So I think that the English certainly are an ethnic group/nation because they have a perceived common ancestry.   09:25, 16\n",

And if you look at the talk page, my issue was with needing to add the creation time, I wasn't even thinking about Giano (had I known adding his name was such an issue, I would have left it off, had I known I was going to be accused of harassment, I would never have even thought of adding it). As for WP:V for making claims about people, I just find that seriously bizarre. You are saying Wikipedia logs are not reliable sources for what Wikipedia editors do? That's pretty ridiculous. The log information stating exactly that information is precisely what readers would have to have had to look at (if they knew how to do it) to even understand the article. Finally, as for not using self references, look at the article context. It was quite clearly nonsense not to refer to the fact that that article had only existed for a few hours. How can you not self reference in that situation? Or are you honestly saying that was not pertinent information, about a claim being made about an article having existed or not? The situation falls squarely between the radio host example and the Siegenthaler incident. Adding a self reference was the only way that paragraph could be written to make any sense.\n",

      "While very many people confuse the terminology for power and energy, it is particularly embarrassing to do it in an article with such a title.   The Watt is a unit of power, the rate of consumption. Power can not be consumed.  Energy, which can be consumed, is measured in watt-hours or joules. \n",
      "\n",
      "The openening sentences which say, \"\"In 2004, the worldwide energy consumption of the human race was estimated at 15 TW with 86.3% from burning fossil fuels.[1] This is equivalent to 0.5 ZJ (= 1021 J) per year.\"\" should be changed to \"\"In 2004, the worldwide energy consumption of the human race was estimated at 0.5 ZJ (=1021 J) with 86.3% from burning fossil fuels.[1]  The average rate of consumption is thus 15 TW.\"\"   \n",

Again, \"\"The energy used to generate 2 TW of electricity is approximately 5 TW, as the efficiency of a typical existing power plant is around 38%.\"\" is incorrect.  One needs 5 TW of power (not energy) to create 2 TW of power at 38% efficiency. \n",
      "\n",
      "Even more unfortunate, I worry that some of the numbers are wrong because of the confusion between power and energy.  For things like wind, where a 100 MW generator operates at only 11% capacity factor, the difference between installed capacity and average production over a long period of time is 9:1.  A dominating factor.  I checked a couple of the references cited, and they too use power and energy inconsistently.  \n",

The same antagonist tried to trash the MASM page that I rewrote earlier and from his comments in its talk page it is only a matter of time until he does it again. An earlier editor tried to get some content into the MASM page by scouring the MASM32 web site and linking to web pages that I wrote for the masm32 user base and while I was willing to tolerate this and did a reasonable amount of work on the MASM page to try and get it up to date and relevant so it was no longer needed, in the face of endless obstruction I will simply resolve the problem from outside Wikipedia.

That wiki had about 20 active users then, and upon some very quick investigation it seemed that I had been caught up in the autoblock of a user who was blocked for one day for some minor policy violation. Anyways, I got an admin to unblock me and went on my merry way. A few hours later, when talking with him and other users on the IRC, I found out that he lives in the southern United States. I live in Alberta, Canada. We were both using the same IP. Beyond my nice little story, I've known User:Matthew2602 for months. I know that he is a good user with only good faith intentions, and I also know that he would like to be able to edit here again. It would be nice if he could be unblocked without large quantities of bureaucratic pointlessness, but that can happen if needed.\n",

It is common for multiple newspapers or journals to publish the same story, sometimes with minor alterations or different headlines, but one story does not constitute multiple works. Several journals simultaneously publishing different articles does not always constitute multiple works, especially when the authors are relying on the same sources, and merely restating the same information. Similarly, a series of publications by the same author or in the same periodical is normally counted as one source. (WP:GNG, footnote 3)\n",

Copts are important part of Egyptian society. I am not saying that the whole section that you deleted should be included, but a few sentences should. Here's an extract from Speigel: \"\"Copts make up the largest Christian community in the Arab world and around 8 million Egyptians belong to the Coptic Church. They're barred from high government positions, diplomatic service and the military, as well as from many state benefits. Universities have quotas for Coptic students considerably lower than their actual percentage within the population.Building new churches isn't allowed, and the old ones are falling into disrepair thanks to a lack both of money and authorization to renovate. When girls are kidnapped and forcibly converted, the police don't intervene. Thousands of pigs were also slaughtered under the pretense of confining swine flu. Naturally all were owned by Christians. The same with Luxor's massacre. For example see article Spain. It talks about bombing in commuter trains in Madrid, Spain on 11 March 2004. Egypt should have a few sentences about the massacre in Luxor's too.   \"\n",

I would support however some sort of guidelines for arbs (and maybe admins) regarding what sort of complaints are clear reason for status change, and what are perhaps valid but less clearcut, and then, if the latter, some sort of discussion, maybe per RfC with a crat closing, regarding the conduct of the individual involved and how to deal with it. Personally, I think the \"\"us\"\" AGK used is potentially problematic, but could just be, potentially, a typo. Arbs are not necessarily required to write all comments like legal briefs, particularly if they themselves are not necessarily lawyers. Of course, if AGK, or any other arb in a potentially similar position, were to resign on their own, should that happen, that might be enough to address that specific situation, but no one should see my saying that as necessarily indicating I think such would necessarily be the way to proceed in this instance, because I don't think the matter necessarily rises to that level.

      "Whilst I feel that this is probably diverting into a debate rather than discussing the article, I do think this reveals one of the fundamental flaws with this article.  It bases its observations, which IMHO verge at the very least on Original research, on how a particular country implements its digital TV system. For example, GeorgeFormby1 misses a great deal of context about the British situation which is relevant here, such as:\n",
      " Digital TV in the UK is strongly influenced by Freeview (and its soon to be launched sister Freesat), which are subscription free digital TV systems that the BBC (the UK's very dominant (compared to the US) public broadcaster is the key stakeholder in.  As pointed out by , Freeview boxes now retail at around £20 (actually around $40).  Although, it may seem a lot to pensioners in the US it is small compared to the annual, compulsory, Television licence fee of around £130per year ($260).\n",
      " Europe has traditionally had a much stronger regulatory framework with regards to broadcasting.  Where as, (if i understand correctly) in the US, cities are well served and rural areas often poorly served (in some cases having to pay to have affiliates and stations from other markets relayed to them so they can actually have a TV service at all), most of the traditional \"\"analogue\"\" channels in the UK and Europe(in the UK: BBC1, BBC2, ITV, C4 and to a slighlty lesser extent Five, whose availability is constrained by the amount of bandwidth that was left in Europe by the time it started in 1997)  are obliged as part of their licence to be available universally i.e. In the UK, >98% coverage of the UK landmass.  This means that European airwaves tend to be very crowded and together with the stronger licensing rules means that there are relatively few analogue channels (UK homes get 4 or 5 channels, and 6 in a *small* number of cities, where (usually) community groups are given a *low* power licence.)\n",
      " The above therefore identifies the reason why a lot of European countries had an appetite for more channels when digital TV came along.  The restricted space available, particularly terrestrially, has meant that channels tend to be crammed into the available space, and indeed some digital channels have a very poor picture quality compared to a good analogue signal.  But this only tells half the story, implementations vary even in one country, for example in the UK compare the bit-rates of BBC1 digital are at about ~6Mbps compared to those on Mux A which run at <2Mbps (e.g. Five Life et al).  Thus, the resultant picture quality is purely down to the implementation,  that various multiplex owners have chosen to take and is not indicative of digital TV in general.  Indeed, as I understand in the US, where homes generally have a much greater number of channels but are \"\"afflicted\"\" with the inferior NTSC system.  The application of digital TV has generally been to deliver HDTV as opposed to large quantities of new channels...\n",
      "... and indeed that brings the question of what it is all for! In the UK and Europe large swathes of digital space are reserved for the public broadcasters (without getting into a debate over whether all this space is used for programming that is truely public service), post digital switch-over this will allow every home in the UK to access free-to-air and  terrestrially (the way most people receive TV in the UK) channels such as BBC Parliament (coverage of parliament), BBC News 24 (likely to be the UK's only free-to-air rolling news channel before long), BBC Four (\"\"high brow\"\" arts and culture), Teachers TV (a channel for Teachers), etc, etc,.  \n",

Maybe we can clean up some of the bad things wwe hear about like the Adscam and GunScam and all of the other Scams plaguing Canada'c Civil Services at every level of goverment. Maybe its because they keep this kind of information so secret that they are able to get away with corrupt activities outside of public scrutiny.\n",

      "Typically, when Xenophrenic sees a valid edit (by wiki policy) that he disapproves of (for whatever reason), he seeks to get others to remove it. This strategy is quite effective as he says the edit needs balance, or needs the proper context, or isn't the full story, etc. There are many different reasons used, but the end result is him adding so much trivial nonsense ( > 2 to 1 ratio in his POV) that average editors cringe when they see it. Xenophrenic then declares that the original unbalanced POV version can ONLY stay if his even more unbalanced additions are there to provide proper context. This leads to edit warring over days and even weeks, articles often get locked down. Some reasonable and responsible editors step in and remove it all in the name of peace and to move forward in improving the article. Xenophrenic gets what he wanted all along, and boosts his edit count with the disruptive edit warring. Some call this tactic a form of wiki-terrorism, I say it shows that Xenophrenic is quite calculated and intelligent, even though he is mostly obtuse during discussions. Talk \n",

      "\n",
      "After deleting the listing of Hardy Parkerson from the listing of Longview's \"\"Notable People\"\" and giving my reasons, the name was re-listed. To be fair, if Mr. Parkerson believes himself or if some one who knows him believes him to be a person who has notoriety because of his connection in Longview, I am willing to let the reader decide.  I do not dispute that Mr. Parkerson is notable for various reasons.  He is known for his poetic ditty's and short rhyming verses.  He is also known very well in Louisiana as an attorney where he practiced for some 40 years.  He has supporters and admirers who may well consider him \"\"famous\"\" as well as detractors who consider him \"\"infamous\"\".  He did not go quietly into the night when he resigned the Louisiana bar and retired from the practice of law.  \n",
      "\n",
      "However, since Mr. Parkerson has lived and worked in Lake Charles, Louisiana since before he graduated from high school; and since he has not done anything significant or notable in his life that has been connected to his early years in Longview; and, since he is not recognized or known by any but a very few people in Longview, it is therefore fair to question his listing as a notable person from Longview.  Unlike others \"\"Notable People\"\" listed in the Longview Texas article, very few references can be found regarding Mr. Parkerson's Longview roots.  (this contributor found only one on the Internet after extensive search). In fact, it is Lake Charles that is referenced as Mr. Parkerson's home.

      "Good day to you, sir. It seems a shame that you have taken this attitude, after all, I did welcome you nicely in the hope that you might want to contribute constructively to this encyclopedia. Wikipedia isn't a spoof website, it's an encyclopedia, so articles that you think are amusing are not nessesarily seen as funny by others. It wasn't actually me that deleted it, I merely flagged it up as being non-encyclopedic and another editor thought the same. Westenders is a nice idea for a parody soap opera, and that sort of thing might be seen as quite comical on a website such as Uncyclopedia, which is as spoof encyclopedia, thus if you want to write less serious entries that may be the place to go. However, if you do wish to contribute seriously, please don't let this setback stop you - perhaps our paths will cross again in a positive context.   \n",

      "is commonly performed by grinding (shaping) the tungsten electrode into a fine, burr-less 'pencil point', using a high speed diamond abrasive wheel. The shape, and angle acuteness of the point, also plays a role in the 'focused' shape of the plasma arc.  The DC arc largely applicable to ferrous metals, benefits from using 2% thoriated tungsten (or 2% ceriated tungsten, an alternative to the radiological concerns of Thorium), while nonferrous metals such as aluminum and magnesium requiring AC current, are performed best with pure tungsten allowing the tip to melt into an enlarged balled surface at the end of the electrode.  A \"\"ball-point\"\" subsequently flares the arc onto a much broader surface of the material, where greater expansion and distortion must then be accommodated, or anticipated as part of the welders job.\n",

Washing, degreasing, rinsing etc, but mechanical abrasion is fast, easy and most popular as shaping a weld chamfer can be done simultaneous to \"\"cleaning\"\".   AlumaPrep (or some brand name like that), is simply an acid rinse to remove stubborn anodizing and any last marks of finger print oil from the 'touchy' AC needing metals.  But as Triddle pointed out in his explanation of +/- wave form capable machines, the plasma itself will often do a fine job of burning off simple surface impurities.  Deep inclusions (ubiquitous in sand casted work) are a frustration all unto themselves.  Welder (the person) tolerance, patience, and experience must often judge what level of weld quality exist after cooling.  High-tech work, demands that the work piece billet is good stuff to begin with, yet there is a variety of filler rod that can be used to accommodate persnickety base material.  Nickle, Bronze and \"\"Everdure\"\" (brand name) are often blended into filler rods, and greatly assist the welder trying to fix cracked engine blocks or other sandy and oil impregnated work pieces.\n",

      "Reactor vessels of all types, be they nuclear or cellular, are also a field unto themselves.  As the physical strength of a finished weld may really be the lesser of engineering concerns.  Chemistry plays a role in both questions of what will actually be held in the vessel, and how it may be cleaned between use.  Low carbon 316 SS (316L) commonly desired for biomedical applications where autoclaving and bleach will still kick the ass out of Stainless Steel.  Titanium and its many grades are like wise a subject for deep thought, but once the decision is made...  it works like soft butter, and few other welds can look so nice raw.\n",

I made such a minor edit to the article, and if there was any mistake, could he not have merely pointed out any errors to me as a newbie instead? Or does he have a problem with allowing newcomers to work on wikipedia as well and merely try to land them in trouble instead? I am not really sure why he is determined to complain about me no matter what edit I make, but his aggressive stance is clear, and if everyone were to behave this way towards newbies, I am sure wikipedia would become a very isolated place, which it is indeed not.

      "Indeed numerous Iranian media pointed that out right away.  That is why I support the idea of including \"\"Jewish\"\" at the beginning of that sub-section of the article.  It is not to \"\"single out\"\" Pilz because he is jewish per se, it is because both Iranian media as well as officials from Foreign Ministry have called it a part of the on-going Zionst smear campaign against Iran.   Pilz' \"\"early anouncements\"\",  had claimed that both final candidates of the Iranian presidency were mentioned in his \"\"extraordinarily reliable Agent D\"\" report.  So no matter which candidate won, he would have smeared the winner.   He had anticipiated that Rajsanjani wins (like most people expected) so he had initially put the focus more on Rafsanjani.  As an Iranian, I also feel this is coordinated. It is indeed hard to explain how the major Western media would be so quick to report all those allegatoins (which so far have turned out to be false) without even a cursory investigation. How could for example, AP, Reuters and AFP all three make the same mistake at the same time? And it wasn't even on just one allegation, it was on multiple.  So multiple News Agencies, making multiple mistakes that a pro would hardly ever do, all at the same time?  And I have seen a pattern like this for years on numerous other anti-Iran smear reports.  Also, you might notice how so many people involved in this very article are Jews or at least their edit history clearly shows their pro-Zionist stance.  I don't think that is accidental either, they are voluntary \"\"contributors\"\" to the same  smear campaign because they view Islamic Iran as a threat to Zionism.  The same people also have an \"\"interest\"\" on the Rafsanjani article and probably many other Iran-related articles.  \"\n",

      "  The disagreement with Yeezus was over his insistence on using the term \"\"Rave Reviews.\"\"  I can't imagine any objective \"\"encyclopedia\"\" using such a subjective term.  What is wrong with allowing reviews to speak for themselves, rather than spin something that is, in itself, already a spin?  In the case of \"\"Reloaded,\"\" the two reviews I mentioned were from \"\"Rolling Stone,\"\" and \"\"Spin,\"\" magazine.  And, contrary to Khanassassin's  assertion that no reviews were overly positive, these two happened to be extremely so, with very little, if any, negative criticism.  There were actually quite a few \"\"raves\"\" for the album, and  I gave extra weight to Rolling Stone because it is a magazine often cited by Dan56, who's edting was serving as my model,  and because Rolling Stone did not base their response on Minaj's \"\"rejection\"\" of hip hop, as some in the hip hop community see her actions.  Being a more rock-base source, the review seemed quite nuanced and even-handed, while many of the hip-hop oriented magazines seemed annoyed with her \"\"pop\"\" side.\n",

The Fourth Amendment, which states:  The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. The Tenth Amendment, which states: The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people. The legal encyclopedia American Jurisprudence says the following in regard to constitutionality: The general rule is that an unconstitutional statute, though having the form and the name of law, is in reality no law, but is wholly void and ineffective for any purpose since unconstitutionality dates from the time of its enactment and not merely from the date of the decision so branding it; an unconstitutional law, in legal contemplation, is as inoperative as if it had never been passed ... An unconstitutional law is void. (16 Am. Jur. 2d, Sec. 178)\n",

But that is not what Wikipedia is about. WP:NPOV implies that statements of opinion, such as The REAL ID Act violates the following articles and amendments of the United States Constitution, are not appropriate in a WP article. It would be perfectly OK to say, however, something like Critics charge that the REAL ID Act violates the following articles and amendments of the United States and then provide a reference to some reliable source\n",

This is a clear instance of original research that WP:NOR prohibits.\n",

      "Regarding HeartBreaker, The Original Tribute to Pat Benatar, please forgive me for not fully understanding what makes this listed for deletion. Perhaps it's just a guiedlines issue? But, what speciffically makes any of the other tribute bands listed on the tribute act page any more notable than HeartBreaker to allow those pages inclusion? Is it the formatting? Unfortunately, I am new to the Wikipedia environment regarding editing and possibly need some direction on this? I came across the tribute acts pages and noticed The Iron Maidens, which is a local group with not as long a tenure in the tribute community as HeartBreaker, although definately notable, and they are incuded. But beyond The Iron Maidens are bands whos accomplishments pale in comparison to HeartBreaker. HeartBreaker IS a notable, respected and an acknowledged band of the tribute community as well as being one of the first of local tribute acts to appear in the L.A. area when the tribute phenomenon began during the late 90s, particularily with a female lead singer. That, in itself makes HeartBreaker a pioneer to the community. What other information or details do you suggest including, other that what is listed in the biography which is certainly not insignificant, in order to make this page more or as \"\"notable\"\" than or as any of the other other listed tribute bands by Wikipedia standards, and to gain inclusion? Please advise. I have perused some of the other acts' pages linked to the tribute acts page and see only a few with significant notability, most have even fewer accomplishments and notariety than HeartBreaker, some I've never even heard of and certainly aren't known to our local tribute community, which definately expands beyond just the L.A. area. HeartBreaker has been written about and featured in reliable sources and is known for it's tenure, quality and respected within our tribute community, particularily since we are one of the longest running tributes AND are acknowledged BY the artist to whom we pay tribute, Pat Benatar and members of her band(s). We are the only band of any kind listed in her official web pages and have been joined by significant original members of her band. This in itself lends support to the tribute act pages. The histoy of the tribute act pages specifically points to acts who are joined to play with the artists to whom they tribute and further goes on the list bands on the page. Why is it not acceptable to list HeartBreaker and a biography of information to support the tribute act pages? We may not have as much notariety as The Iron Maidens but we certainly are not insignificant and definately are more notable that some of the listed bands. HeartBreaker was featured in a televised documentary about tribute bands on a major network and has been written about and listed is major publications. How can any of this not be notable when this is in regard to tribute bands?????? Please explain. Thank you.\"\n",

OWB needed to face what he faced there, and wikipedia, and OWB, will be better off if this process isn't pretended away. you said something about \"\"i don't know what went on with you two\"\". really? all that went on was utterly public. i've had no private comm with OWB. so if you don't know what went on, then you didn't pay attention. if you're not paying attention, maybe you might consider stepping back and not jangling your admin keys so readily.\n",

The problem, he says, is \"\"style\"\", which he believes \"\"very clearly explains the problem\"\".  He prefers to delete content rather than help to edit the page to allow its inclusion.

      " Could you explain why you think the addition is ungrammatical in the parenthetical comment?  Do you have a proposed solution that will avoid deleting content, or is deleting content your purpose?  The opening can be reworded, rather than deleting content.  Please note that the pronunciation, even of \"\"common\"\" words in English is of value to both non-native speakers as well as native-born speakers, since even common words may change pronunciation within a proper name.

But either way, it's not obvious vandalism. It annoys admins when people throw that term around. Or at least me. And as for \"\"Is United States to be the only country in the western hemisphere\"\", I point out that \"\"United States\"\" is the only country name in the Western hemisphere made up entirely of common words, without proper names. (\"\"of America\"\" is different, of course, but the audio file isn't about that name) So there is an argument to say that it is the country least in need of a pronunciation guide, since there's no unusual or proper words in that particular name.   \n",

The word \"\"united\"\" has no encyclopedia article here, nor pronunciation given, for a non-native speaker to examine.  Also, the word \"\"states\"\" is a plural, and English plurals have two possible pronunciations for the added final \"\"-s\"\": /s/ or /z/, according to rules that native speakers learn but which non-native speakers struggle with.

It would be far more accurate to say that Armstrong was once considered to have won the Tour de France seven times. This state of affairs is very unlikely to change. As for emphasis, at this point Armstrong is more known as a cheater and a fraud than as anything else. As time passes this is bound to  intensify. Since it is now obvious that Armstrong achieved his original fame by cheating and committing fraud, there is no reason he should not be more known as a cheater and a fraud than as anything else.\n",

If you check Alanya article on wikipedia main page today, you will see that the name is rendered as Alaeddin Keykubad for the first and foremost one. To add an opinionated note, I am expecting little initiative from my fellow Turks on putting the name of an old sultan in correct form, ruminating cattle as many are.

The difference is that Cox belongs to a schismatic organization that is several levels removed from the Catholic Church. Williamson, in his association with the SSPX, was directly ordained by a Catholic Church bishop and remained Catholic, even while not in full communion. Note that the Catholic Church affirmed that attendance at an SSPX chapel would fulfill the Sunday obligation, i.e. in a \"\"Catholic rite\"\". I do not know if the Catholic Church has commented on the canonical status of the Irish Orthodox Catholic and Apostolic Church, or the validity of the Thuc line of apostolic succession.

I think that adding Mary Millar in the list of statistics confuses many since it is just a similar spelling and that would be better handled as a See also on the dab page.

I know that if that had been stated to me initially, I would have understood - because it's a reasonable statement and observation, and I don't want people to have problems reading the page - and had no problem removing the Jimbo gif from my page.  Snarkily saying that the Jimbo gif makes one either annoyed or \"\"nauseated\"\" and will keep others from taking me seriously, is neither helpful nor clear as to the real issue, is it?    \"\n",

      "Plato not \"\"part of the Socratic entourage\"\" or \"\"inner circle\"\"?\n",
      "At the beginning of the Plato and Socrates section of the article, someone had said, \"\"Plato made himself seem as though he were part of the Socratic entourage but never says so explicitly.  ...  In the Apology, Plato distances himself from the inner circle.\"\"  I believe this involves a misunderstanding of how Plato represents himself in the Apology.  I would not be prepared to say that Plato considered himself \"\"part of Socrates' entourage\"\" or Socrates' \"\"inner circle\"\"; but that's only because it's not clear what whoever wrote this part of the article means by \"\"entourage\"\" or \"\"inner circle\"\".  Is it made clear elsewhere in Plato's dialogues who did belong to the \"\"inner circle\"\"?  So far as I know, Plato never mentions an \"\"inner circle\"\".  But he certainly portrays himself in the Apology as one of Socrates' young devoted followers, in quite explicit terms in fact.  Given this fact, I think it's simply misleading to suggest that Plato somehow went out of his way to \"\"distance himself\"\" from Socrates or Socrates' devoted followers.  So I've edited this part of the article accordingly, including textual citations.  Comment if you wish.  \"\n",

English speakers call it China in overwhelming numbers. This is also the conventional short form used by the CIA and the UN and we have decided that that is what we will use for country names here. If we don't stick to that then we are expressly taking sides in political naming issues. The fact that the PRoC is currently trying to dissociate their government from \"\"China\"\" (which seems counter intuitive for a totalitarian regime..) is an interesting thing to mention in the article on the PRoC at China. If we change the name of the article to follow political correctness of the PRoC that is an express act of support for their policy. I for one say we defer such naming matters to higher authorities such as the CIA Factbook, the UN and especially what is most commonly used by English speakers. True they are POV institutions but transcribing what they use is a passive and not express act of POV. Wikipedia is not in the business to decide what the names of nations are  other institutions are far better suited at this highly charged topic.

      "No point in concealing the fact that oil and gas exports and petroleum price play important role in the Russian economy. However there is no point in highlighting this fact too much since it borders with spreading the myth that Russian economy is only oil and gas and nothing or almost nothing else.\n",
      "Few facts:\n",
      "Significant growth of oil prices started only in 2004-2005, but the Russian economy started growth (and rather large growth) well in 1999-2000. \n",
      "Russian economy is not only export. The recovery of oil and gas and other minerals was only 9% of GDP in 2011  and only 6.8% was oil and gas  (with figures not much larger in the previous years). The share of oil and gas in GDP gradually falls.\n",
      "Unprocessed oil and gas takes only 45% of Russian exports. More of the rest are oil-based products and fuels, but this is considered manufacturing . So the phrase in one of the last edits about the \"\"oil and gas, which is the majority of Russian exports\"\" is oversimplified, and certainly not correct if we speak about raw materials vs manufacturing.\n",
      "Federal budget grew much faster in the last decade than oil prices . And it is not clear whether \"\"a five-fold increase in price of oil and gas\"\" is correct description - it was four-fold increase in 2000-2011, but seven times increase in 1999-2011.\n",
      "In 2008 only 23% of federal budget revenues came from exports oil and gas (customs tariffs), and 18% from taxes on petroleum and mining companies . However, when we speak about the consolidated budget (federal budget + regional budgets) the similar figures for oil and gas would be just 14% and 10% .\n",
      "All this means the following:\n",
      "The economic growth in the early 2000s was not very much dependent on oil and gas prices. So it is incorrect to ascribe early economic growth under Putin to petroleum prices.  \n",
      "Overall, the dependence (whatever its scale) of the Russian economy on oil and gas is not Putin's invention, and the share of this sector in the Russian GDP actually is falling.\n",
      "However, oil and gas money constituted a very large share of the federal (but not so consolidated) budget in the Putin era. This means that it is more correct to speak that it is not the Russian economy on the whole, but the federal budget which is dependent on oil and gas.\n",
      "And a qualitative addition to the figures: Russia is a northern cold country and Russia is industrial country, which means that it needs lots of fuel for itself, but it is also a (very) resource-rich country, so no wonder that it produces much energy, have lots of facilities for that, and takes the opportunity to export abroad a lot (every country in similar conditions does that: the U.S. , Canada, Norway). This is not good or bad feature of the economy, just the fact.  Talk \n",
      "We need to revert your additions on oil and gas simply because they are not entirely correct factually, and because all the key information in more generalized and accurate form is already in the lead.

Without any help from the official campaign, Ron Paul supporters have coined the term \"\"The Ron Paul Revolution.\"\" They developed the concept for the Guy Fawkes Day money bomb back on November 5th which raised over $4 million. They hired a blimp to fly over New Hampshire to promote the Ron Paul campaign. Last Sunday, they held a tea party, where they broke John Kerry`s single day primary fundraising record by collecting another $6 million.

      "    To understand where Rich is right now is just half the equation, the other half lies in his history. Much of Rich's music tells the story of that history. Born in Riverside, California at just 15 years old his journey began. It was Rich's deep rooted love and passion for music evolving from a family of musicians, which really allowed him to turn his life around. This turnaround was despite all the trials and tribulations of his youth, while residing in Moreno Valley, California.\n",
      " \n",
      "   Once in Seattle, Washington Rich embraced hip hop and rap music as well as the culture. Rich realized thru listening to the lyrics of others that he could really relate to what these rappers were saying. That is when Rich knew he too could share all that history he had bottled up inside thru his own lyrics. This is when hip hop really took over his life. Rich's level of musical development exploded, so he then channeled all his energy into writing and producing his own music. Rich is a producer and creator of addictive melodies, with beat wizardry that captures his audiences’ attention. They become mesmerized by his verbal versatility with stories, outlining and defining his truly most turbulent times.\n",
      " \n",
      "   In 2003, Rich established a Washington, D.C. Metropolitan based Management, Production and Promotions Company called; HardHead Records. This brings us back to where Rich is today, HardHead Records has now commenced an exceptional business network with key associates in the music industry. Since its inception, Rich has gravitated towards some daunting, precarious projects highlighting the true and reliable nature of the company.\n",

      "I disagree with the above allegation of bias in the article.  I found no similarity between the Vassar Web site and the article.  The information in question - the attractiveness of the campus - seems fairly innocuous and is fairly similar to the type of information in Wikipedia articles about other liberal arts colleges and several universities.  The article reads like synopsis of commercially available background information in colleges guide books.  While I would have written the main paragraph differently, I hardly think this qualifies as biased, and without some criteria to differentiate this page from other pages on other schools, I believe the objection should be removed from this page.\n",

However, if you edit the page to remove said \"\"bias\"\", please re-read your edits before saving the page. Simply removing phrases and not doing a little copyedit makes the page read poorly. I have made some minor edits just so that it reads a little cleaner, hopefully not restoring anything that you feel is biased. I think the bigger issue is that this page has become a series of lists (academic majors, famous alums, residence halls) with little encyclopedic content and is an embarrasment compared to other articles about comparable schools.

      "I just wanted to say that professional doctors in Brazil often use it along traditional Western health care (generally after, prescribing together with allopathic treatment, NEVER as medicine). There is an idea here of people of using it in the same way a vaccine could do good i.e. that thing I mentioned earlier with my experience, a really great quantity (in terms of homoeopathy, that is nearly nothing – that former doctor of mine explained the most common homoeopathy to my mother using the joke of the comparison to seawater) of dead ill-bearing beings together with herbal medicine. But I think no sane person would qualify it as cure anywhere, even in the limited demographics that homoeopathy, to say, can improve 5-20% of their immune system functioning (but all immune systems are different because every human is a universe, perhaps in most people something so light that is reason of mockery such as hpthy is likely worthless). Alternative medicine approach is not something to trust (much less alone) in case of death-threatening diseases – in the immune system example, homoeopathy would be used in light to mid allergies such as the source of my rhinitis, with a grain of salt in more serious conditions (together with traditional treatment – like what cured me from chronic sinusitis and otitis, and I attribute it more to the non-homoeopathic treatment), but I don't expect an effect at all with auto-immune conditions. If someone offers it as medicine, it is obviously quackery, but I think that the point of Mkweise is not how homoeopathy can kill by the ignorance of some users and/or shamelessness of quackers, but how it is said to not work in every situation, with nobody, and all scientific research adequately using methods of demonstrating it, what millions of people that are not necessarily ignorant (including 3 former doctors that saved my life that hadn't no profit with the so-called quackery) would disagree to.

      "I agree with Travellingcari. The tags serve a useful purpose, even after the article is brought to AfD, and especially so when they have been on the article for a significant length of time. They make it clear to visiting editors that any interested parties have had a fair chance to improve the article, and hadn't, which is often a point used in support of deletion. Conversely, if the article isn't tagged, it's not clear that interested parties have been given a chance to improve the article, which may be used to support a keep argument. Removing the tag makes the status either way less clear. Yes, it's available in the history, but why make editors go through the extra work of checking the history? In addition, an AfD can end without reaching a consensus, which means the tag most likely still applies and would have to be restored. No, the time to remove the tag is after a consensus has been reached at the AfD that the subject does meet the notability guidelines, i.e. after it is closed with result keep (or in some cases, when the eventual outcome is clear per WP:SNOW).

Students participate in a minimum of twelve hours of orientation meetings with their teacher-leaders.  During these meetings, students participate in practical activities including journal writing, role-playing, civic responsibility, and community service. Students are responsible for completing assignments and preparing projects based on research of the country or countries they'll be visiting.  In addition to attending these classes, students are also responsible for completing online courses for certification which include destination-specific information on government, history, culture, and geography.  High School credit is available through the Washington School of World Studies.  For an additional fee, high school students may elect to earn college credit through the Eastern Washington University.  As a classroom teacher and leader, I really appreciate all the preparation involved during the pre-travel segment of the program.  The selection process of students through three letters of recommendation and an interview session enhances the environment with a clear focus on learning.\n",

      "I see that Jughead has added a pretty nifty graph which represents all known oldest people at a given time from 1830 to the present date. But I can see a few problems right off the top - for one, the chart should start from 1955 which is really where the record starts in any substantive manner, as that is when the record started to be kept and subsequently amended back to. While we may be able to compile a list of oldest people going back into the 19th century, besides the fact that patchy birth records make such a compilation somewhat meaningless, any compilation beyond what already exists on this page would be original research. \n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, it is hard to really understand what the graph represents, with a lot of tiny dots. Close clusters of dots really represent  the fact that record-holders held the title briefly, a low cluster means someone held the record for a long time. Which was only really true after 1955. The chart implies that Betsy Baker who is represented by the dot circa 1955 held the record for a whopping 25 years, which is obviously not so. And thirdly, the current record-holder just turned 115, yet is shown as being 116.\n",
      "\n",
      "My suggestion would be to keep the vertical axis as is, but to create a bar graph for individual years of BIRTH starting with the first record-holder Betsy Baker's birth year, 1842, draw a bar for the maximum age attained for any person born in that year and do the same for each year up to 1892, the most recent birth year for which no people are proven still alive. And this would not be original research, as there is a page with this list: . There is someone for each year save 1845 there.   \n",

      "Hello! I am a student at Drake University enrolled in a Wikipedia:Wiki Ed/Drake University/Global Youth Studies (Fall 2015):course that is striving toward taking out the systemic bias out of Wikipedia. My proposed edit is not extensive yet, but I am using my sources to explain the global side of popular music. It also explains how it is difficult to label something as popular music or not. I touched on the connection between world music and being labeled as an \"\"exotic other.\"\" I chose a couple of genres of music that are popular in different countries to explain how something may be popular in one context, but not another. The edit also discusses how the digitization of music has impacted the popular music field by allowing artists to become famous through social media. I am still not totally confident with my edit because it is very short at this point and I am nervous that I am trying to discuss different genres too in depth. I am also nervous that I am trying to make an argument out of this article because I am discussing the different countries' popular music genres. Later this week or this weekend I will be linking my proposed edit to this talk page. Thank you!   \"\n",

I have begun a discussion on the projects talk page to see how the members of the project feel about this suggestion.

      " VHarris44 was clearly not someone completely new to Wikipedia. That much is very clear from their skill in navigating Wikipedia, such as posting a help request on their talk page and posting Advert tags on articles, right from the first day of their activity. This is someone who had prior experience on Wikipedia. It is also I believe reasonably well established that VHarris44's behaviour towards me was inappropriate, they were afterall permanently blocked for their behaviour and four requests by them for a reversal were turned down. There is also the issue of VHarris44 having known details about my university. Did they really find this from looking through the history of my talk page? That has to be extremely unlikely. \n",

      " So the obvious question is, who is VHarris44? A very logical possibility is, another experienced user that I have serious disagreements with. To my knowledge there is only one user in that category. Now in view of the timing of that user's retirement, the fact that that retirement quickly followed their failure to succeed in getting a page that I had created deleted, the fact that one of the only edits during their retirement was to undo one of my edits, and the fact that they then remerged so quickly following my difficulties with VHarris44, this is all very strong circumstantial evidence that VHarris44 and Codf1977 are the same person.  So was Codf1977's detailed exposition of their view of my dealings with VHarris44 here: User talk:TFOWR#Rangoon11's filing of Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/Codf1977 and his other actions yesterday.\n",

They both seem to have poor spelling. 'such big changes must be agreed in talk page' is an edit description which both Codf1977 and VHarris44 have used. Ultimately there is little text written by VHarris44 to go on though. \n",

I can accept that others do not feel the evidence sufficient. However I have been blocked on the grounds of harrassment for making a complaint based upon that circumstantial evidence. That seems very unfair, for even though others may not believe that there is sufficient evidence that Codf1977 and VHarris44 are the same person, I really struggle to see that others cannot see the circumstantial evidence that I saw and therefore relate to why I felt compelled to post a message on the admin board.\n",

      "Ethnologue version 14 (valid from 2000 to 2005) contains different information from Ethnologue version 15 (from 2005 onwards). Any person qualified to write on Greece would know that there was no census in Greece in 1986 (they happen every 10 years so the nearest ones were 1981 and 1991) and that the last time \"\"mother tongue\"\" and \"\"most frequently used language\"\" were asked in a Greek census was 1951. The number for the \"\"mother tongue\"\" question (the other number for frequently used language was even smaller) did make it into Ethnologue v.14 but Ethnologue v.15 for reasons that can only be guessed (pretty easily I may add) chose to come up with a fake census and a figure in the 200k region. Anyone that has enough brains to pass a thesis examination for a Ph.D. (as Taivo has) is capable of looking at the differences between Ethnologue v.14 and Ethnologue v.15 and noticing suspicious changes based on sources dated before 2005. A clear example is in Arvanitika: v14 claims (correctly - I wish I knew how many speakers there were left) a range between 50,000 (Newmark) to 140,000 possible speakers (1977 Trudgill and Tzavaras). v15 comes up with 150,000 (2000) without a clear attribution (what happened in 2000) or an explanation of how a language in clear decline increased in numbers. Moreover v15 creates a new category of 10k speakers of Tosk Albanian for the region of Epirus; this is now separate from Arvanitika despite the fact that the page on Arvanitika still includes the reference to a Northwestern Arvanitika dialect from v14 that could only have referred to the region of Epirus. There is a clear inference (from the text as well) that the inclusion of this new category is related to the political issue of the Cham expulsion (and the claims about \"\"Orthodox Chams\"\"). Finally the very concept of what these numbers mean is in doubt. The north of the village of Andros is mentioned for Arvanitika: bilingualism in our families ended with our grandparent's generation. Extremely few among our parent's generation could converse in Arvanitika - the rest retained a few words or curses and our generation still has those (if at all). To portray the area as Arvanitika speaking is so misleading that it can only be done on purpose.\n",

Until then use of non-existent census figure in Ethnologue makes a mockery of the academic standards they so passionately purport to be trying to uphold.\"\n",

One might count the Ptolemies as the Thirty-second Dynasty, but I don't know if any reliable sources do so. They're either called \"\"the Ptolemaic dynasty\"\" or \"\"the Ptolemies\"\" or \"\"the Lagides\"\".

      "It is true that geological studies show changes of the environment that contradicts the strong Gaia hypothesis of ecosystems working towards an optimum state. It is also true that there is evidence that ecosystems have collapsed from within. However, the frequency of such ecosystem collapses through geological history is many orders of magnitude lower than the extremely high frequency predicted by the Malthusian model of maximum reproduction. So evolution must be driven by something other than maximization of reproduction. The selfish gene model (the theoretical mechanism basis of the Medea hypothesis of life destroying itself) appears to be supported by simple computer simulations, but so does strong Gaia hypothesis. The strong Gaia hypothesis failed scale-up to more complex systems, and the missing frequency of Medean ecosystem collapses can be explained if the selfish gene model also fails scale-up to the greater complexity of real life because real life is too complex to be livable to such rigid, unselfcritical entities as the selfish gene model claims that living organisms are. In other words, the selfish gene model is based on the same methodological error as is the strong Gaia hypothesis. This is explained in greater detail on the pages \"\"Moderating the Gaia/Medea debate\"\" and \"\"Self-organization\"\" on Pure science Wiki, a wiki devoted to the scientific method unaffected by academic prestige obsession.\n",

      "I did find it surprising that nowhere is due process mentioned in Arbcom's procedures. There is a fourth problem that hasn't previously been mentioned which is the lack of any practicable route of appeal for Arbcom's decisions. Yes, in theory Jimbo is the final \"\"court of appeal\"\" but that is not a route which anyone takes seriously, as far as I can tell. In practical terms the only recourse is to appeal to Arbcom itself, but how likely is it that Arbcom will admit that it's got something wrong? If Arbcom's conduct during a case has thrown due process out of the window, what is the likelihood that it will find itself at fault? Human pride and institutional defensiveness, if nothing else, will count against it. Right now, if Arbcom commits an abuse of process there is no way of correcting it other than voting out the offending arbitrators, which could take years depending in which tranche of elections they're due to come up for a vote. There is no process for anyone other than Arbcom to review cases, nor for egregious mishandling of a case to be tackled. In effect we have a single \"\"accountability moment\"\" once a year and there is no accountability, no recourse and no effective oversight of how they have conducted themselves. What is needed, I think, is a much stricter set of rules governing what Arbcom does, combined with an independent appeals procedure that is empowered to review Arbcom's own conduct and set aside remedies if they have been passed without due process being followed.   16:11\"\n",

First I am not sure what you have accomplished by suppressing the publishers' understanding of the Singapore Math method. You may disagree with them, but it is still valid in a Wikipedia article to report what the publisher believes about their own work. I actually agree with much of your evaluation, but in order to keep Wikipedia neutral, our opinions should not be used to decide what to report and what not to report. The publisher's own description of their books should be included in this article.

By deleting what the Math Panel said leaves the reader under the impression that the Math Panel reviewed Singapore Math (they did not) and are in agreement with all of the features of Singapore Math. Their precise statement was, \"\"The Singapore standards (Singapore Ministry of Education, 2006) provide an established example of curriculum standards designed to develop proficiency in a relatively small number of important mathematics topics, as validated by a recent analysis (Ginsburg et al., 2005).\"\"\"\n",

      "Kelly knew what color her eyes were when she made the song \"\"Behind These Hazel Eyes\"\". Comparing the pictures of Kelly and Belle, they do seem to share the same eye color just slightly different shades of it - Belle's eyes are little lighter. Someone made a video called \"\"Behind Belle's Hazel Eyes\"\", the person who made this video knew what color Belle's eyes were and decided to include Belle's name in the title. And if you read the comments, the people fully agree her eyes are hazel with comments like \"\"green or hazel? they look more hazel than brown or green . yup belles﻿ eyes are deffinetely hazel problem solved\"\". I like the \"\"problem solved\"\" part. With Minotaurgirl's bias against the idea of Belle having hazel eyes, I think there will always be a problem with people like her involved.\n",

      "TV Tropes has already suffered an edit war because of her, so much so they forbade users from writting what Belle's eye color is.

Belle's name was there under the category of Hazel Eyes until Minotaurgirl came along and ruined it all. Same thing almost happened to Disney Wiki. This is Minotaurgirl's account, as you can see she got blocked with an expiry time of infinite, the reason; inserting false information, the false information being writting down Belle's eyes as brown.] And now here's Minotaurgirl on the Wikipedia. Is there any repsite from her?\n",

She thinks she actually proved Belle's eyes are brown, depsite the fact what she has presented as evidence is either a minority or a plain old lie, like the screenshots she send me. By magnifying the images, you can see her eyes are hazel-colored and not the same color as her hair at all. Notice how she's afriad to use close-ups of Belle's eye cuz she knows they'll appear hazel if she did so, thus disproving her. On her blog, she didn't mention that she was blocked on Disney Wiki, and said the only reason Disney Wiki kept Belle's eyes color as hazel was to shut up people who keep writting her eyes as hazel, when in reality the one who got shut up was Minotaurgirl as she got blocked while the others didn't. She wrote \"\"Bleh. Kids these days. This one needs a hobby. I'm tired of wasting time trying to undo this snot's damage, and I'm fairly sure the mods of these sites are too. Would it be possible to just...block this person off the internet entirely until they learn some manners?\"\" Yup, she calls people who use logic and legitimate evidence to prove their point snots and hobby-less kids if the evidence goes against what Minotaurgirl said/believes.\n",
      "\n",
      "If anyone deserves to be blocked, it's Minotaurgirl. If it wasn't for her bias, sites like like TV Tropes, Disney Wiki and the Wikipedia wouldn't have suffered an edit war about Belle's eye color. The fact that there was never an edit about Belle's eye color until Minotaurgirl came along, says a lot. Ever since she got blocked from Disney Wiki almost an year ago, no edit war about Belle's eye color happened there either. It's like Minotaurgirl is the only person on the entire internet who refuses to accept Belle's eyes as hazel and is willing to go to every page and change her eye color to brown, just cuz she likes to think so, not because the world thinks so or any legit evidence are presented. It's like someone going around changing Ariel's eyes from blue to green, just cuz he likes the idea of Ariel being green-eyed. Thinks don't work like that.\n",

      "The Catholic Church example is a good one, but I'd like to point out several key distinctions. First off, its an old enough institution that a separate History of the Catholic Church article exists, which makes the main article in reality The current status of the Catholic Church or maybe A summary of the Catholic Church, this is not the case for the NRA. We have a single article that is trying to address its entire history along with its cumulative activities, so the Lead needs to reflect that. Second, with all of the various controversy involving the Church, none of it mentioned until the last paragraph. Third, it's Lead 1st sentence is fairly generic simply stating that its the largest organization of its type and how many members it has. I would be fine with something similar, \"\"The National Rifle Association of America (NRA) is a nonprofit organization with 5 million members.\"\" But quite frankly, that seems too simplistic and not terribly descriptive or informative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, if we take a clinical look at what they do today, its a variety of things that range from publishing and multi-media (television, internet, etc.) to training and certification programs to historical preservation along with lobbying and other political activities. So to describe the organization in the 1st sentence using any kind of phrase that includes \"\"gun control\"\", gun rights\"\", or the like is just bad writing and purposely ignoring significant parts of the article, hence my original suggestion for the Lead first sentence. At the very least, I don't see why the first sentence can't just be generically descriptive. Maybe something like, \"\"The National Rifle Association of America (NRA) is a nonprofit organization that primarily serves as an advocate for firearm related issues and activities. Originally founded in 1871 in New York by journal editor William Conant Church and General George Wood Wingate to promote marksmanship within the United States military, the organization has gone through several transformations as well as expanded its purpose and goals. In the 21st century, it has become one of the largest and most influential lobbyist groups in Washington D.C. as well as a large, multi-title magazine publisher, an advocate for hunters, outdoorsmen, and the , and one of the largest firearm training and certification program operators in the U.S.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, I will try to find other examples, but given this list (:Category:501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations) it does not seem difficult to find an article with a Lead first sentence like I've described. By the way, I'm advocating for a rewrite of the ENTIRE WP:Lead, not just the 1st sentence. I think that Policy is fairly clear, but IMO to adhere to it properly in this case Editor's need, to quote the WP:Lead page, a specialized understanding of the subject in order to write it in a NPOV manner that a non-specialist will understand. This is something beyond what a magazine subscription or occasional mailing will provide.  (Talk) ☮ღ☺ \"\n",

      "Posted on 29 August, 2006\n",
      "\n",
      " Maronite Catholics attacked a newly-built, independent Baptist church near Beirut this month, mauling churchgoers preparing to host war refugees from southern Lebanon. \n",
      "\n",
      "The violence flared up after of several weeks of tense public debate between Maronite and Baptist clergy. More than 20 men from Ajaltoun village attacked Christ Bible Baptist Church on August 2, slashing car tires, breaking the church door and windows, stealing computer and sound equipment, beating men and groping several women. \n",
      "\n",
      "Compass Direct, Aug 22, 2006 \n",
      "\n",
      "A group of 10 Maronite men assaulted Baptist Pastor Raymond Abou-Mekhael and another church member at 6:30 p.m. as they were on their way to retrieve items from their parked cars. The Maronites broke the unidentified church member’s rib and both men’s glasses, smashed the car windows and then dumped the two men inside before joining another group of 10 in attacking the church building. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Police were at the church watching everything,” Abou-Mekhael, 35, told Compass. “They even advised the attackers on what to steal and vandalize.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Abou-Mekhael said that the men were led by Ajaltoun Mayor Khalil Tabet, who had the church officially sealed off with “red wax” immediately after the attack so that no one could enter the building. \n",
      "\n",
      "In an August 6 newspaper article entitled, “No Justification for Building a Baptist Church in a Region whose Overwhelming Majority is Maronite,” the local Maronite bishop attacked the Baptist church’s right to exist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bishop Guy-Paul Noujaim wrote in local newspapers that there were “no followers of the Baptists in Ajaltoun,” and the “decrees of the Middle East Council of Churches [to which the church does not belong] prohibit building a church in areas without followers therein.” \n",
      "\n",
      "In an e-mail to Compass, Bishop Noujaim said that the Baptist congregation had requested a permit to build a residence but had instead built a church. He declined to answer questions about whether he had been aware of plans to attack the church on August 2, but said that he had been celebrating mass at a church in the mountains when he received a telephone call alerting him to the violence. \n",
      "\n",
      "In articles published in Addiyar and Annahar newspapers, the bishop called for the attorney general to close down the building. \n",
      "\n",
      "“This is nonsense,” said Salim Sahyouni, President of the High Council of Evangelical Churches in Syria and Lebanon, to which the Ajaltoun Baptist church belongs. “We can worship in a legal church building, we can worship in an apartment and we can worship in the free air.” \n",
      "\n",
      "As a Protestant community in Lebanon, “we have the full rights to build churches to worship freely in any place we choose,” Sahyouni told Compass. “We do not need to get permission.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Worship Rights \n",
      "\n",
      "In his written responses to Compass, Bishop Noujaim did not specify why it was illegal to hold church services in a home but claimed that the Baptists were violating the law by owning a printing press in the basement of their building. \n",
      "\n",
      "The bishop’s biggest complaint was that the Baptists aimed to steal Maronite members of his flock. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Why don’t the Baptists want to be part of the Middle East Council of Churches?” the bishop wrote, referring to an ecumenical council of Orthodox, Catholic and certain Protestant churches that he said forbids proselytizing each other’s members. “Don’t they support ecumenism and dialogue? If we are mistrustful of the Baptist people, it is because of their bad behavior.” \n",

      "=The Signature of the Atomic Bomb\n",
      "There are good reasons to claim that the catastrophical event of the atomic bombing of Japan, marks the shift to what we here term contemporary in regard of art as defined in the contents page per 27 October 2010, or 19 Dhu al-Qidah 1431, or 19 Heshavan 5771. Butoh may thus be regarded as the epitome of contemporary art. Except from this, it is a problematic definition for a number of reasons. First. Art by artists working both before the World War II, during and after, can not necessarily be defined as more, or less, contemporary because of this timestamp. Contemporary art did explicitly exist also before World War II, as this label - contemporary - has been expressed as a mark of quality, pertaining especially to modernism, by art carrying an ideal summoning, from the artist or his genius, making some kind of composed expression of what, in such case, are to be evaluated or considered the spirit of the time, reflecting or in dialogue with the contemporary world, in the event of the art-making process including its publication or presentation. Another trickster is, for me, that the concept of contemporaneousness also must be regarded in relation to art that specifically deals with contemporarity as it moved through time. It is absurd as a Norwegian to not consider Henrik Ibsen a maker of contemporary art. His plays are distinguished by being contemporary plays and historic plays. I sincerly believe that Henrik Ibsen was intending to make drama that also were to be transformed, or may I say be transported by the unfolding of time. The retrospective style of his contemporary plays is at least a strong indication for that his plays not necessarily should stay in the conformity of the 19th century. I think it is possible to find many other reasons for striking out such a definition of contemporary art as this lexicalisation implies.\n",

It had very little basis in reality, in my opinion, but leaned heavily on communist atheism and anitclericalism, and the destruction of churches (and  in some cases  torture, murder, etc. of clergy and members of monastic orders) that occurred in the opening weeks of the war. I think the article is accurate in saying that the atrocities in those opening weeks were roughly equal, but the fact that many on the Republican side targeted the Church was endlessly exploited in the Nationalists' rhetoric, and struck a note with conservatives elsewhere who otherwise might have kept more distance from fascism.   17:55, 14 Mar 2004 (UTC)\n",

We know better now. Communists wanted to overthrow the legal system of liberties in Spain to create a system similar to that of the Soviet Union. General Franco and his coup prevented that. Of course, the Republican legality was not restored, but that was because it had not proven safe from revolutionary risks. And Monarchy was not restored probably because King Alfonso XIII fled the country only because his partisans lost a municipal ballot, so it appeared to the victors in the war that that king was not reliable to grant individual rights.

As to Dayewalker's gender: if Dayewalker (or one of Dayewalker's friends or acquaintances) would simply state that Dayewalker wishes to be referred to by the male or female personal pronoun, that works for me. I don't care which Dayewalker actually is. Whichever they wish to have used here is fine. Until then, and basing my guess on the name alone, and ascribing no gender traits to any of Dayewalker's words or actions, I have referred to Dayewalker as a she. If that is not the correct gender, just cut the rhetoric and say that Dayewalker should be referred to with a male pronoun. If Carol O'Conner could live with his name and constant gender misidentification, one hopes that an adult with the name Dayewalker should realize people are going to offer up their best guess at what gender pronoun to use.\n",

Maybe Dayewalker is \"\"Daye Walker.\"\" Makes sense. I can't know for sure, but it appears that \"\"Daye Walker\"\" is a woman as Daye Walker puts another name that would appear to be a maiden family name in parenthesis. However, in a modern age, that may not be what she is indicating by this choice of presenting her name, nor is that taking of one's spouse's family name upon marriage universal to either gender, But why guess when someone could simply state the fact?

      "Viktoria Daynekos born on 12 May 1987 in village in the Kirov Taldy-Kurgan area. Her childhood was spent in the Yakut city Mirny (Yakutia). Since her childhood, she dreamed of becoming a variety singer, but her parents did not take her desire seriously. In school, Victoria (Vika) started to sing various Mirny (Yakutia) musical genres, mainly covering the hits of others. As she was in a small town, without any special educational institutions, Vika educated herself.  Vika seriously engaged the English language.\n",

      "In 2004 Victoria was the participant of the Channel One’s teleproject Star Factory Series 5 under the direction of Alla Pugacheva, which she won. Within the limits of the teleproject, Victoria sang two solo songs — «I will be better» and \"\"Leila\"\".  Vika also sang a duet with Alexander Marshal «Dreamed me». ((I Dreamed?!  Dreamed of me,?!)) The duet was so pleasant to the public, that it has been decided to make a joint clip — Victoria's first video.\n",

New songs with which, Vika acted on the various platforms, new further clips have followed. In parallel with this development, Victoria's life was often discussed in press—in 2006, the singer dated the member of the group «Korni» Pavel Artemyev. Although the affair did not last long, it has left a trace — a clip plot on a song of Dayneko «I will simply leave from you at once» (\"\"Я просто сразу от тебя уйду\"\") based on the idea of director Victor Priduvalov and a hit has been closely connected with the Korni’s clip «You want I will sing to you» (\"\"Хочешь, я тебе спою\"\")\n",

Moreover, (ab)using this historically inconsistent argument, they go further to say that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict dates back to biblical times. Linking the Palestinian/Philistines to their supposedly Indo-European ancestors, they argue that the Jews (an anachronism since at that period they did not exist as Jews, before the Babylonian Exile) stole the Land of the Palestinians at that very early period.

However, the measurements are the measurements. And even when all kinds of corrections are taken acount of, the temperatures now are warmer than they were 100 years ago.

And they have very characteristic temporal and spatial frequencies corresponding to oscillations of a rotating sphere. A bit hard to wave your hands to make those observations go away. You might be able to do it if you were really an excellent applied mathematician and willing to spend a few months in crazy speculative inverse theory computations. Currents of course are possible, but these are very special kinds of currents that have special kinds of characteristics that match what one would expect from a fluid on a rotating spherical earth. I have personally seen the curve of the earth when standing on a very high point. Now of course it could be an optical illusion, but it is a very compelling one if it is. However you can put it down to refraction or some other optical effect. In fact, you could even put photographs of the earth from space down to those. As I said above (and you nicely demonstrated my point), you can explain almost ANYTHING away and maintain some pre-conceived notion if you are willing to throw away parsimony and the demands of prediction, etc. \"\n",

      "Thanks Flyer22 that was not my guess.  Here's what the NBC website says, the official site, not a message board: Lucas was injured when a beam fell on his legs and EJ agreed to save Lucas only if Sami agrees to let EJ have his way with her. Sami reluctantly had sex with EJ and helped him escape to Mexico, after he was wanted in connection with the shooting of John Black. Despite Sami’s attempt to turn over a new leaf, EJ returned and pressed her for information on police activities, and she was pulled into another web of deception, trying to prevent him from learning she was pregnant. That's from Sami Brady.  That tells me the show's official position is that she agreed.  What a character says and what the show's position is in this case are not the same.  Since Ed Scott took over, only Lucas has used the word and Sami and EJ have shared a couple of kisses as well as reading the Santo and Colleen letters together. It has been indicated they are going to \"\"tighten things up\"\" and fill in some wholes. The anticipation by some fans (I know, there's that \"\"some\"\" word but that is the case with people I have encountered) is that the December 29th issue will be resolved soon.   \"\n",
