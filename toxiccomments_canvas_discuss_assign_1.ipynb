I was quite impressed with how level headed your second reply to me was (you didn't immediately go into a defensive ego trip like some others I've bumped into. Very much appreciated.

      "\n",
      "While there are occasional exceptions, a visit to virtually any article on any city in the world (new or old) doesn't show the pattern of a long list of multiple old not in use historically insignificant foreign names on the first line. For instance FYROM/Republic of Macedonia's title  lists Macedonian: Скопје, pronounced [ˈskopje], Albanian: Shkup, or Shkupi)[1] (their two largest demographics). There is no mention of older Turkish and ancient Greek pronouncement for Skopje).  So it seems very fishy to me that obscure Greek islands are seemingly being prioritized with old Turkish occupation names over major cities.\n",

      "\n",
      "Unless you can demonstrate that these obscure alternate foreign language name qualify as \"\"Relevant foreign language names used by at least 10% of sources in the English language or used by a group of people which used to inhabit the geographic place\"\"... I don't believe an obscure set of Greek islands remotely qualifies for this rule of prominent display. And this point of sensitivity to names is further clarified at the head of the geographic naming convention article where it explicitly states...\n",
      "\n",
      "Historical names or names in other languages can be used in the lead if they are frequently used and important enough to be valuable to readers, and should be used in articles with caution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice the words \"\"and should be used in articles with caution\"\". I think it's pretty clear that the Balkans are an extremely sensitive area with regards to names. (it stirs the pot for old ethnic conflicts)\n",
      "\n",
      "I think perhaps you've misunderstood my motivations here a bit. The issue for me wasn't whether the names could be mentioned (they obviously always should be in there somewhere)... but exactly where in the article they are mentioned. Unless it is historically important (e.g. Constantinople) any mention of older historical Turkish or Greek occupation names should only be added later in the article in a historical or etymological context.... not be given equal airplay upfront with current names or historically unimportant names.  Doing so is both bulky and highly provocative to sensitive political regions. (and incidentally the same rule should apply for inappropriately using historically insignificant Greek names for Turkish cities)\n",

      "I'm sticking to my guns that my edits were kosher according to existing Wikipedia geographic naming conventions and current widely observable conventions. I'd even go further and suggest leaving those old historically insignificant foreign names prominently displayed is far more disruptive than removing them (both in a Wikipedia sense and in a human toll sense) I therefore would like to once again remove those old names from the first paragraph but will delay pending your response to me (to confirm I have (or have not) convinced you of the accuracy of my assertions)\n",

      "Objective: To assess the factors, including helmet use, that contribute to head linear and angular acceleration in bicycle crash simulation tests.\n",
      "Method: A series of laboratory tests was undertaken using an oblique impact rig. The impact rig included a drop assembly with a Hybrid III head and neck. The head struck a horizontally moving striker plate. Head linear and angular acceleration and striker plate force were measured. The Head Injury Criterion was derived. The following test parameters were varied: drop height to a maximum of 1.5 m, horizontal speed to a maximum of 25 km/h, helmet/no helmet, impact orientation/location, and restraint adjustment. Additional radial impacts were conducted on the same helmet models for comparison purposes. Descriptive statistics were derived and multiple regression was applied to examine the role of each parameter. \n",
      "Results: Helmet use was the most significant factor in reducing the magnitude of all outcome variables. Linear acceleration and the Head Injury Criterion were influenced by the drop height, whereas angular acceleration tended to be influenced by the horizontal speed and impact orientation/location. The restraint adjustment influenced the outcome variables, with lower coefficients of variation observed with the tight restraint. \n",
      "Conclusions: The study reinforces the benefits of wearing a bicycle helmet in a crash. The study also demonstrates that helmets do not increase angular head acceleration. The study assists in establishing the need for an agreed-upon international oblique helmet test as well as the boundary conditions for oblique helmet testing.\n",

If you are disagreeing with the fact that anti-Hindu violence is real, then you should get your facts correct (and wikipedia here will not help you, unfortunately). Google is full of webpages, until you subscribe to Ad_hominem#Ad_hominem_circumstantial, common around here, then it will be a littler harder to find.

I am personally entitled to my opinion that his theory is laughably ridiculous - Islamic terrorism - enough said. Regarding having found books about religious violence in India, who is saying it is not present in India? I am saying that no such country exists with two different religions coexisting, and no act of violence ever happening. Having found books doesn't make it worthy of having an article about it.

This explains why I am gone; it also explains why many others, including some extremely knowledgeable and helpful people, have left the project. \n",
      "\n",
      "The root problem: anti-elitism, or lack of respect for expertise. There is a deeper problemor I, at least, regard it as a problemwhich explains both of the above-elaborated problems. Namely, as a community, Wikipedia lacks the habit or tradition of respect for expertise. As a community, far from being elitist (which would, in this context, mean excluding the unwashed masses), it is anti-elitist (which, in this context, means that expertise is not accorded any special respect, and snubs and disrespect of expertise is tolerated). This is one of my failures: a policy that I attempted to institute in Wikipedia's first year, but for which I did not muster adequate support, was the policy of respecting and deferring politely to experts. (Those who were there will, I hope, remember that I tried very hard.) \n",
      "\n",
      "I need not recount the history of how this nascent policy eventually withered and died. Ultimately, it became very clear that the most active and influential members of the projectbeginning with Jimmy Wales, who hired me to start a free encyclopedia project and who now manages Wikipedia and Wikimediawere decidedly anti-elitist in the above-described sense. \n",
      "\n",
      "Consequently, nearly everyone with much expertise but little patience will avoid editing Wikipedia, because they willat least if they are editing articles on articles that are subject to any sort of controversybe forced to defend their edits on article discussion pages against attacks by nonexperts. This is not perhaps so bad in itself. But if the expert should have the gall to complain to the community about the problem, he or she will be shouted down (at worst) or politely asked to \"\"work with\"\" persons who have proven themselves to be unreasonable (at best). \n",
      "\n",
      "This lack of respect for expertise explains the first problem, because if the project participants had greater respect for expertise, they would have long since invited a board of academics and researchers to manage a culled version of Wikipedia (one that, I think, would not directly affect the way the main project is run). But because project participants have such a horror of the traditional deference to expertise, this sort of proposal has never been taken very seriously by most Wikipedians leading the project now. And so much the worse for Wikipedia and its reputation. \n",
      "\n",
      "This lack of respect for expertise and authority also explains the second problem, because again if the project participants had greater respect for expertise, there would necessarily be very little patience for those who deliberately disrupt the project. This is perhaps not obvious, so let me explain. To attact and retain the participation of experts, there would have to be little patience for those who do not understand or agree with Wikipedia's mission, or even for those pretentious mediocrities who are not able to work with others constructively and recognize when there are holes in their knowledge (collectively, probably the most disruptive group of all). A less tolerant attitude toward disruption would make the project more polite, welcoming, and indeed open to the vast majority of intelligent, well-meaning people on the Internet. As it is, there are far fewer genuine experts involved in the project (though there are some, of course) than there could and should be. \n",

We have a scalar equation in the radial length and the two forces equate to the second time derivative of the radial length. You have got too much bogged down in trivia over matters like whether or not the second time derivative of radial length is entitled to be termed radial acceleration or not.\n",

This is an utter no-no on Wikipedia — an involved administrator, who himself is the epitome of most administrators (abusive, unkind, and unjust [not a personal attack]), blocking someone he dislikes.

While the current details about ZCMI are pretty good, and the list of stores when the chain wwas closed down is pretty accurate, it is hardly an exaustive list of stores that have been in existance.

Part of this history should include how members of the LDS Church would face excommunication if they shopped anywhere except at ZCMI.  I am not kidding here.  Several LDS Church members were removed from the church rolls because of this seemingly irrational justification (based on modern sentiments).  Keep in mind that there was a coordinated economic plan to try and push the non-Mormons out of Mormon influenced areas, and this is really in keeping with other business traditions of 19th Century America as well, including Standard Oil and others that would be illegal with current fair trade laws.\n",

And the decision to sell ZCMI to May department stores was mainly a way for the LDS Church to get out of that sort of business.  What is surprising is that is was a subsiderary of the LDS Church for so long, making it into the 21st Century.  The LDS Church has divested itself from other businesses it started back elsewhen like a Sugar Company and a chain of Hospitals, and in that context ZCMI is just one of several aspects of life in Utah.   \"\n",

My concern is why a vote that basically said \"\"I don't know\"\" means it stays at Burma. By the Cabal's conclusion...If the article had happened to be frozen at Myanmar before the mediation, and we had the same Cabal, it would now be a Myanmar article. I can see where the Myanmar side would be unhappy. However why should the Burma side agree to abide by the next decision? You can bet that with every panel of mediators that might side with Myanmar you will find at least as many panels that side with Burma. Husond is right, where does this end? When I first looked at this mess I said, and posted, that with the current evidence on both sides editors and mediators will NOT be able to reach a FAIR compromise that will appease both sides of this issue... no matter how much thought is put into it. There are good points for each argument. I'm in the Burma camp but that is how I see things. So I'm looking at 1) leave it where it is now, 2) split it into 2 identical articles, 3) some bizarre bot that switches it back and forth daily, 4) a new type of mediation that imho will not end this by any stretch of the imagination.

      "The subject homophobia and the definition of the term homophobia are not the same thing. The subject of homophobia is (in short) the fear or hatred of gays, or discrimination or prejudice against them. The AFA is a recognized part of a body of groups, people, and ideas that define modern-day homophobia. There's no way you can deny that, even if you believe that the label is undeserved, that the label could be pejorative in a non-encyclopedic context, or that somehow being categorized under \"\"homophobia\"\" and being an organization somehow equates to being categorized as \"\"homophobic organization.\"\" The categories \"\"homophobic organization\"\" and \"\"homophobe\"\" were deleted because they are, grammatically, constructed to specifically modify or describe the subject in question. \"\"Homophobia\"\" is not, and these false analogies may make it seem like we're out go get the AFA, but we aren't. Although Sam seems to think it's an irrelevant personal comment, it is the case, Hal, that since you got here, you've been arguing that the AFA's opinion of itself should more of a part of the article, and that criticism should not be. Miles have been spun about how much of a big deal this is, that we're gay activists, that we're creating attack articles, that the category homophobia is a pejorative attack on whatever it labels. Now, Sam, I know you'll insist on removing this part of my comment (editing/censoring others' comments is a practice that is, by the way, fairly dubious). But remember that we are supposed to discuss the issue at hand, not the character of others - I'm not attacking Hal's character. But his history of editing for the sake of the AFA is completely relevant to this discussion and a part of the issue at hand - it explains why he believes we've constructed an attack article (hardly), why the category is a pejorative attack or accusation (clearly not), and why it must be eventually removed. I agree with Hal: it could be taken as a pejorative, and what concerns me is that it is, but only (as far as I can tell) by someone who's made it clear that portraying the AFA in a positive light is very important (no matter [[WP:UNDUE|what that entails).  \"\n",

Comparing one year of tobacco fatalities with one thousand World Trade Towers seems too obvious to miss.  In fifteen years the World Trade Towers equivalent to tobacco fatality rates would cover every square inch of Manhattan, and the simulated collapse of even a third of that number would be a most memorable image for television.

      "\n",
      "In your correct information for the articles of your Wikipedia, you must read and analyze all the bibliographical data and to understand well the problems of a taxon or a group of let us taxa.  Thus, you can note that Rognes is the only amateur faunist (and not a recognized specialist), who wishes to make \"\" revolutions \"\" in taxonomy, without knowing Bengaliidae, without knowing the morphology of dipterous (in general), without being able to make a correct identification according to the male genitalia even of usual Calliphoridae.  In more he wanted to introduce an aberrant and specific terminology for his pupils of the school of handicappers of Stavanger (Norway) where he works, and was unaware of always the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature.  All its \"\" research \"\" is not recognized by the community of the specialists.  Only his friends of the same structure, namely:  Thomas Pape (the recognized intellectual robber and the most stupid taxonomist nowadays), C Thompson, N.L. Evenhuis, J.E. O' Hara and (unfortunately) A. C. Pont wrote a bibliographical work, nonscientific, in which they mentioned exactly what I have says to you before on Rognes.  He cannot identify any species of Bengaliidae and he does not have competence to establish that Bengalia testacea  is the species-type of the Bengalia kind.  This false type was mentioned before by Sabrosky in a stupid work of bibliography (nonscientific), in collaboration with the same ignoramuses collaborators (1999:62).  You must know exactly that of Zumpt until Lehrer, the species-type of the Bengalia kind is Bengalia labiata R.D. - not B testacea sensu Duponchel 1842 & Rognes, which is a nomen nudum. \n",

Regarding a “fav” or famous fossil list, I think it would become intractably long, not to mention the subjectivity involved. I’ve already noticed that the Lagerstätte page has fallen victim to subjectivity, as several listed sites are not traditionally considered to meet the admittedly fuzzy criteria (i.e., extraordinary fossil richness or completeness); 100 paleontologists would generate 100 different lists.

      "Note: Many articles about the rabbis of the Talmud and Mishnah are derived from the archaic Jewish Encyclopedia, published between 1901-1906, over one hundred years ago (when the Middle East was still under the thumb of the Ottoman Turks) and which used the archaic expressions \"\"Palestine\"\" when referring to the Land of Israel, and to the Jews living in the areas of the historical Land of Israel as \"\"Palestinians.\"\" This is a big mistake that requires constant attention and correction, especially when copying and editing articles from the Jewish Encyclopedia or from similarly archaic sources such as Easton's Bible Dictionary (1897). At this time, no-one uses the term/s \"\"Palestinian/s\"\" (in relation to anything associated with Jews or the land they lived in and which they regarded as their homeland) nor by any type of conventional Jewish scholarship, particularly at the present time when the label \"\"Palestinian\"\" is almost entirely identified with the Palestinian Arabs who are mostly Muslims. Finally, kindly take note that the name Palestinian Talmud is also not used and it redirects to the conventional term Jerusalem Talmud used in Jewish scholarship. Thank you.  \n",

      "Okay...it's not cool for people to keep moving the article back and forth.  We should agree on a single solution before anyone moves forward with any major action.  I am personally for the \"\"Fourth International (United Secretariat)\"\" title because, while I am generally (not officially) a supporter of the FI, I recognize that there is some historical ambiguity, and am seriously interested in the neutrality question here on Wikipedia.  When you mention the FI, you are invariably asked \"\"which one?\"\"  And the truth is that \"\"United Secretariat\"\" will always answer the question.  I feel that it's different from titling the article \"\"United Secretariat of the Fourth International,\"\" which is misleading, as that's the now-defunct body that directed the FI for 40 years.  We're disambiguating, because \"\"Fourth International\"\" is touchy ground for Trotskyists outside of the FI (you know which one).  \"\"Reunified Fourth International\"\" isn't used by anybody.  \"\"Fourth International (1963)\"\" posits a 1963 founding that didn't really happen.  \"\"Fourth International (United Secretariat)\"\" is also parallel to Fourth International (ICR), where the organization identifies itself as \"\"The Fourth International\"\" but the article uses a no-longer-present body to disambiguate it.  Any move at this point is going to be, in some respect, not entirely neutral in its point of view.  Given that reality, I think that recognizing convention and using the United Secretariat, while clearly explaining the nomenclature issues up front in the article, remains the best way to present the FI as it has been since 1963.    \"\n",

When some misguided fool would start to preach a false doctrine that went against the Bible then the church simply said hay look the Bible says this and if you reject what the Bible says then you cannot be a Christian. There were no conspiracies or dark room meeting. Why didn't the church have a set Cannon until about the 320 ADs - because there were no fake writings until the Gnostic gospels were written and some were fooled by them so the church was forced to make a list of the real Bible verse the Gnostic ones. Why did the Church have to speak about the deity of Jesus - because the gnostic Cults began to make up false writings and so the church simple said - JOHN SAID JESUS WAS GOD BELIEVE IT OR GET OUT. The same thing is happening today. Why is there so much talk about Homosexuality in the church today - Simple, there was no need to speak of it until the Homosexual community started to twist the Bible and now the church is forced to say HAY THIS IS WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS. It happened in the 1860 regarding Slavery and I'm sure it will happen in the furture when some other group comes along and tries to add to the Bible.\n",

Anyone with a basic familiarity with the Irish language in a modern context will be able to tell you that \"\"Fianna Fáil\"\" means \"\"soldiers of destiny\"\" - fáil being the genitive of fál, destiny, and fianna the plural of fiann, soldier, much as in \"\"Amhrán na bhFiann\"\", the soldiers' song, and Lia Fáil, the rock of destiny. It's the name of a party, for God's sake, and the article about that party also confirms it means \"\"soldiers of destiny\"\": Fianna Fáil. The Fenians were a minor Republican group, and \"\"Fál\"\" isn't even an English word...I'm sorry, but the sources – as I'm sure other speakers of the language, native or otherwise, will be able to confirm – are just wrong. Unless anyone has a legitimate reason to object, I'd like to correct the glaring spelling error in the original Irish, and correct the stupidity of this translation.

      " Hi there! Thank you for your querie about the Humanistic teachings of Nichiren Buddhism. Let me start by saying that the title \"\"Humanistic Buddhism\"\" is rather sematically weak: because there are no 2 types of Buddhism: one Humanistic and another non-Humanistic. I think we should alter the title into \"\"Buddhist Humanism\"\". If you trace the word Humanism you'll find various views: Christian Humanism, secular Humanism...etc... and adding the term \"\"Buddhist Humanism\"\" is appropriate. \n",
      "\n",
      " Secondly, the term Humanistic Buddhism or Buddhist Humanism, whether in China or Japan or the USA, is based on the Buddha's teachings - in particular the teachings of the Lotus Sutra. (The article mentions this clearly). The Lotus Sutra - of course - is not a private property of a certain temple or nation (Chinese, Japanese etc...) Buddhism of the Lotus Sutra is a universal teaching for all Humanity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Historically, it was TienTai of China who placed the Lotus Sutra as the highest of the Buddha's teachings. Later it was introduced to Japan and the Tendai Sect emerged upholding the Lotus teachings, which was the ground for Nichiren, who appeared in 1222, to declare his teachings based solely on the Lotus Sutra. Currently, a 12 millions Samgha Nichiren Buddhist group (the Soka Gakkai International) is actively working for: \"\"Spreading Buddhist Humanism in the Community\"\" http://www.sgi.org/about-us/members-stories/spreading-buddhist-humanism-in-the-community.html\n",

      "Buddhist Humanism: http://www.daisakuikeda.org/main/philos/buddhist/buddh-05.html\n",
      "\n",
      " I think it is more accurate and more professional to refer to Buddhism as either Theravada or Mahayana. In China or Japan, you have Buddhist schools which are either Theravada or Mahayana. There is no such thing as \"\"Chinese\"\" Buddhism and \"\"Japanese\"\" Buddhism. Using the term Chinese or Japanese Buddhism is plainly wrong. For example Zen has branches and temples in both Japan & China. It remains Zen. No need here for confusing \"\"passport\"\" added to Buddhism. Nichiren Buddhism is found all over the world but mostly parcticed in Japan, this does not make it Japanese, but correctly: a Mahayana school based on the Lotus Sutra. It is even not logical to speak about Humanism and Humanity and in the same time restrict Buddhism to artificial national descriptions of  Chinese and Japanese terms. \n",
      "\n",
      " Wikipedia articles must be impartial and must bring various views. Humanistic values of Buddhism cannot be patented to this temple or that priest only. All respect worthy people working to spread Buddhist Humanism must be acknowledged.

I have not once been treated fairly and I don't see you doing it or anyone here that bothers to hang around here.

You want fair rules start making and enforcing them fairly and changing the unfair ones here starting here and now (but you wont).

Doing such edits is distracting and eats up bandwidth, which is not free. Also sometimes when it rains outside you can watch the bodies rise up out of the ground in the cemetary of off Governess Drive. If you look really closely at a snowflake you will realize that the circumfrence of a watermelon has nothing to do with the escape velocity on Uranus. However that realtionship is much concrete when we speak of the astronomical body otherwise known as Urmomsanus. Plus you have a tiny little piece of wallaby DNA in your genome right now. Apparantly, according to an inside source (God, duh) one day back in 600,000,000,000,000,00 BC one of our ancestors mated with a wallaby and now all humans have this one wallaby gene which allows us to benefit from the new, pound shedding weightloss supplement. If you our any member of your family needs to loose weight just use the wallaby gene idiot. Problem solved. No more questions in life, just relaxation and collecting the money as it comes puring in.

I don't need to repeat this. I think there is something wrong with you if you need some book to tell you that this record is NOT Trance, and it is NOT from the Acid House movement. It clearly shows you were not part of the original scene and you are no longer qualified to speak on the early years. My guess is you came into the scene around 1992. It's expressly forbidden to listen to it? I think your going off here. This website is about music, I think it is important to actually hear what we are talking about. In fact references to the actual vinyl releases for most statements on this page hold more merit than books or articles. Why? Articles written on Trance are highly suspect and not scholarly sources. Even if they were written from some 'reputable source', half the time it is written by some nerd who has it completely wrong, or interviewed by some DJ who has an adgenda to 'attach himself' as some creator. Much like anything else they are opinions. The actual vinyl records themselves and the dates they were released are more relevant than any book. (I can't remember how to do the line break sorry)\n",

But no, it doesn't mean that if Pedro slips up 9 months from now, he's going to be insta-blocked for all eternity.  And, as for being on the recall list: Pedro asked me a long time ago if I'd have any objections to being on the list, and I said no.  That's about it.  As far as I am aware, being on the list means that I have the option of petitioning Pedro to relinquish his admin privileges, nothing more.  It doesn't mean I'm obligated to stalk all of his edits and make sure he's behaving.  At this point, I haven't seen any evidence that would convince me that he is no longer fit to be an admin.  Were the comments uncivil?  Of course they were.  Do they deserve a desysop or a block?  In my opinion, unless there is clear evidence that this was more than just an isolated incident of a personal attack, then no.  Everyone screws up from time to time.  We don't desysop/block people because they had a bad day, unless it can be shown that they've been having a bunch of bad days recently, and that it is disrupting people's ability to contribute to the encyclopedia.  Frankly (and I know you will probably all see this as the cabal protecting itself), I see this as a witch hunt against an admin that you don't particularly get along with.  If you have a real issue with Pedro and you have real evidence that this is a long-term problem, then please present evidence in the form of diffs and I will gladly evaluate it.  But, I'm not going to waste my time searching for it myself, because my hunch is that this is not going anywhere.  | spout _ \"\n",

The term \"\"Occam's razor\"\" first appeared in 1852 in the works of Sir William Rowan Hamilton (1805–1865), long after Ockham's death circa 1349. Ockham did not invent the razor, so its association with him may be due to the frequency and effectiveness with which he used it (Ariew 1976). And though he stated the principle in various ways, the most popular version was written not by himself but by John Ponce of Cork in 1639 (Thorburn 1918).\"\"\n",

Indeed, were FISA and Title III interpreted to impede the President’s ability to use the traditional tool of electronic surveillance to detect and prevent future attacks by a declared enemy that has already struck at the homeland and is engaged in ongoing operations against the United States, the constitutionality of FISA, as applied to that situation, would be called into very serious doubt. In fact, if this difficult constitutional question had to be addressed, FISA would be unconstitutional as applied to this narrow context. Importantly, the FISA Court of Review itself recognized just three years ago that the President retains constitutional authority to conduct foreign surveillance apart from the FISA framework, and the President is certainly entitled, at a minimum, to rely on that judicial interpretation of the Constitution and FISA.\n",

Dopamine and melanin have very similar structures, and dopamine metabolism produces a form of melanin called \"\"neuromelanin,\"\" which is different from eumelanin, pheomelanin, et cetera, but still certainly a melanin. Neuromelanin gradually accumulates in the neurons of the substantia nigra throughout a person's life. Kids have very little, elderly people have lots. When people get Parkinson's they start losing their neuromelanin, and their SN goes pale. The fairly recently-published histology and pathology books I'm using just take it for granted that the loss of neuromelanin is basically a side-effect of dopamine depletion. But I may have been a little too confident in assuming that that's the final word. I just checked the National Library of Medicine website and a bunch of new research is turning up more immediate connections between neuromelanin and Parkinson's than had been suspected. Also, it looks like they're also getting promising results in studies on therapies that involve endocrine manipulation of neuromelanin. Still, all of this specifically involves neuromelanin in the dopaminergic neurons of the SN, and I haven't personally learned, heard or run across anything stating that there is any connection whatsoever between skin melanin and Parkinson's. But I guess the take home message for me is that there is more going on here than I realized, so I can't write off the possibility that there is alsothough I can't imagine howsome emerging connection between neuromelanin/Parkinson's and a person's skin melanin levels. Anyway, as you say, this article is about melanin generally, not just skin melanin in humans, so regardless the Parkinson's link is legit.  19:57, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)\n",

It would be ideal to have some other citations to show it's been recognized outside of the show itself, but I believe sufficient notability has been met, and the tag needn't be there.\n",

As I understand it, Wikipedia practice allows primary sources (in this case, the show itself) to act as a source for anything relevant to rules and how the game is played and what happens.

All that yanksox and crazy russian etc care to point out are, what they perceive as being negative.

To being a well balanced article where others can read all the links and see the videos and come to there own occlusions. Yousef al Khattab was also not born in 1971 nor was he born in Brooklyn,He did not move to Palestine in 1997, and amongst those versed in Judaism his criticisms of Judaism are based always with a evidence from Rabbinical Jewish text like Talmud and Mishna etc. I request that the page be set back with the original text including all pictures of his family,articles about him, and videos. We believe that people can make there own decisions based on a COMPLETE viewing of the videos,not the OPINIONS of those that.

In 1997 he began working throughout the Balkans.  Marino was a member of the Vatican delegation sent by Pope John Paul II to Belgrade on April 1, 1999, at the height of the Kosovo conflict. He was also part of a delegation sent to the White House before the 2003 start of the war in Iraq, as the pope sent a plea for peace. Marino sat in on a meeting between President George W. Bush and Cardinal Pio Laghi.\n",

      "Not to burst your petty little power trip, but it isn't exactly fair game to ban someone just because he was right and you were proven wrong. When someone accuses another of being an 'anti-semite' just because the ADL has labelled him as such, I want to point out to to the Wikipedia audience that however horrible it may be, 'anti-semitism' actually originated from the United States, not Nazi-Germany, though it later adopted it from the likes of Madison Grant and Charles Davenport. Wikipedia's own article on Henry Ford states as much, yet when I bring it up in a Talk section, I get accused by the likes of you for vandalism and banned.\n",

You can CALL ME all sorts of names, yet I in return am not allowed that privilege. You are deliberately colluding with THF and Collect (two other sockpuppets on Prescott Bush's page) to get rid of as much 'inconvenient' information as possible. Perhaps it's just because you're really clueless and really don't know alot - that would be at least the half-way respectable scenario, and the least weighing on your conscience.\n",

      "You want your audience (who I presume you want to delude, that is, unless you really DID NOT KNOW Henry Ford published The Elders Of Zion) to remain in a paradigm - without ever knowing where anti-semitism originated from and what a joke it is to see the ones who PROMOTED the concept of 'racial purity' and 'Aryan superiority' to Hitler to remain free of persecution. You use that 'ploy', that 'slogan', 'anti-semite', 'crank', as a silencing technique. It's a deceptive con-game, especially when you never get at the heart of the matter - where the anti-semitism came from, who started the ball rolling, and hey, guess what? The source of origin is a very unlikely one, and very unfortunate and inconvenient indeed for the self-righteous Americans always eager to trot out charges of 'anti-semitism'.\n",

      "Unfortunately for you, and your sources, Prescott Bush's collusion with the Nazis is a well-established fact, and is well-documented in numerous high-profile books on the subject, including Trading With The Enemy: An Expose of the Nazi-American Money Plot. What you have constructed thus far are 'strawmen' arguments and falling back on 'guilt by association'. You peddle establishment sources as the ultimate harbinger of truth, perhaps KNOWING or NOT KNOWING the complete collusion of mainstream news with the establishment. More unfortunate for you, still, is that President Calvin Coolidge, Woodrow Wilson, Margaret Sanger, the father of JFK and countless other Americans clearly believed in the Nordic/Aryan races' superiority and viewed the Nazis as good. Worse still is that FDR refused to take Jewish refugees from Nazi-Germany. Even worse, university professors were making statements in 1936 to the tune of 'Hitler is beating us at our own game - race hygiene and sterilization'. This is all documented in books such as Edwin Black's 'War Against The Weak' - and don't come with your silly, puny little slogan such as 'conspiracy theorist' just because you don't care and don't want to know.\n",

And of course, being an American, you want to uphold this concocted, grand noble myth that you're the good guys and you fought Nazism. I can only tell you haven't looked into the eugenics history of your own country, or the Royal Institute of Intl. Affairs Conference of 1938.

I do appreciate that its location is already described in the lead as crossing between things X and Y but if you don't already know Stockton well (or recently!) this is not necessarily all that helpful. I was wondering if you could write a more bottom-up description which says something like \"\"the bridge crosses the Tees at blah (or near Blah Street etc); it is A hundred metres downstream from the Foo Bridge and B hundred metres upstream from the Bar Barrage\"\" or whatever, which it seems to me would nail it in more empirical terms. What do you think? Any yes, of course the maps link does nail it (assuming the co-ordinates are right!) but something in the text which helps in this way would, I think, be very useful. I may be being unusually thick  (happens all the time, actually) but on my first reading - and I was last in Stockton in 2007, you see - I was not at all sure where it was, wondering if in fact it replaced the other rather nice pedestrian bridge closer to the town centre. I cured this uncertainty by looking at the maps, yes, but the sentence I'm asking for would have given me more direct access to the knowledeg. Go on, please write it for me, you know you want to; and I will go and put the kettle on for you. Thanks and best wishes   \"\n",

But if a tram class is unique to a particular network, the issue of naming is less clear.  There are several en.wiki articles about Australian trams that are named in the following form: W-class Melbourne tram.  However, that form doesn't seem right to me.  I would suggest that a more appropriate form would be Milan series 1500 tram, which is a form consistent with the naming of many articles about locomotives (eg British Rail Class 47).

Again I refer you to Wikipedia:Deletion_guidelines_for_administrators#Rough_consensus for this information.  (Anonymous authors who request that their articles be deleted are often given consideration, but not those who want them kept.)\n",
      "Whether they're specifically enumerated on What Wikipedia is not or not, articles about neologisms are not encyclopedia material.  Firstly, #2 on that page indicates that Wikipedia articles are not dictionary definitions, and as a neologism is just a particular kind of word, an article on a neologism is necessarily a dictionary definition.  Secondly, encyclopedia articles cannot describe neologisms because they cannot describe things that are as yet unestablished.  \"\"No-boo\"\" may or may not be a word with some currency today, but it remains to be seen whether it will become part of the language.  Once we can determine that the term has staying power and is culturally or historically significant—which time will likely not come for months or years—then we can write an article on it.  Or rather, we could, if it weren't going to be just a dictionary definition.\n",
      "If the article in question is not about a word but actually about an event called \"\"The No-boo Affair\"\", then it ought to be entitled No-boo Affair.  In that case, I would still vote to delete it, on the grounds that it is a news story.  Again, there is no evidence at this time that this news story is going to have any historical significance, and considering that the substance of the news story is \"\"the AP made a mistake; they said some people booed at a speech but really nobody did\"\", it seems very unlikely that it will ever have historical significance.  (You characterize the AP's error as a \"\"clear falsification\"\", but I see no evidence of malicious intent by the AP, and anyway it's still not an encyclopedia's job to document falsehoods by the AP.  If the AP has a history or pattern of such falsehoods, and it is well-documented by other unbiased sources, then we can make a note of it in Associated Press.)  If the term \"\"no-boo\"\" becomes well established—which, again, we will not know for months or years—then perhaps it will be appropriate for us to record this news story as the origin of the term.  Certainly, Wikipedia has articles on other recent news stories.  However, most are stories of definite historical signficance, and those that are not should also be deleted.\n",
      "Wikipedia wants articles on items that are currently in the news, yes.  In this case there are many things related to the story that people might want to look up.  If we didn't already have them, we could add articles on George W. Bush, William J. Clinton, West Allis, Wisconsin, booing, the Associated Press, the White House, the Republican National Convention, New York, etc.  But this \"\"No-boo Affair\"\" is not an encyclopedic topic in the news; it is a breaking news story.\n",

      " Note to Administrator Regarding Above Move Request \n",
      "\n",
      "To the administrator who will review the above move request.  Note that the names used in these articles were chosen after many months of discussions, discussions that included a wide variety of editors.  The compromise solution was to use Trentino-Alto Adige/Sudtirol, the Province of Trento, and the Province of Bolzano-Bozen.  This was a compromise that kept both the Italian and German usage in the names, and was also the usage in Encyclopedia Britannica (to name just one major English source).  There is slander going on above by Mai-Sachme when he says that individuals engineered this solution, or did it by some form of trickery.  He also went as far as to erase a similar warning to the reviewing administrator.  It is a little shocking, but maybe not surprising, that after a few years a certain editor tries to put things back to how he originally had placed them unilaterally.  Right here what we are seeing is nothing less than than a ambush of this page and I strongly suspect that he has contacted a lot of these editors thru e-mail to ask them to come and support this ambush.   It is no coincidence that within a couple of days all the German-speaking users who happened to be against the compromise solution show up to vote for this.  This is utter abuse of Wikipedia.  So, again, if Wikipedia is at all fair, this move request should be struck down.  It is FACT that in English both the names Alto Adige and South Tyrol, AND Province of Bolzano are in regular use.  Go to any grocery in the United States, and products from this region are advertised as \"\"wine from Alto Adige\"\" or \"\"speck from Alto Adige\"\".  Yet, the same editor who makes this move request (and others who are voting here) has constitently attempted to marginalize the name Alto Adige on this page, or remove its bold typeface next to South Tyrol, or even acknowledge that it is used commonly in English (just review the edits made on these pages over the past year).  What it truly shameful is that this cements the fact that there is no room in these particular people's minds for compromise and to a solution that allowed an Italian/German naming convention.  Wikipedia is NOT a democracy, and this ambush of the page to try to revert the page to a German-centric viewpoint by sending a dozen German-speaking voters here is just wrong.\"\n",

That's probably especially true of radio personalities with an on-air name that is actually two given names but sounds like a given name and a last name (I've seen that happen quite often), and that happens with various other stage names and pen names that are derived from given names.  But as a general rule, no. Some like Ann-Margret make it clear by normally using a hyphen. The problem, of course, is that our articles, especially the stubs and sub-stubs, often do not have enough information to make it clear what is going on.  If it is \"\"Mary Lou\"\"  or something of the sort, common combinations of given names where the second one is much rarer as a surname, especially if it includes the actual surname in the article itself, it should clearly be under M in any category (the redirect which should be there, or a dummy one if needed because otherwise it would be a disambiguation page, could be categorized if the full name were desired in some categories, and when that is done a note on the article page is helpful).

      "That article is ok I guess, the Androgyny section could use a better explanation, but meh. I dumped some stuff into the section about docking to dead ships/stations, cause it was just so crap and WRONG. Needs some polish now, as I didn't delete anything, just added a nice read which could be trimmed, but that article is very short and could use some meat on it's bones. Anyhow \"\"the Shenzhou spacecraft could to dock at the International Space Station if it becomes politically feasible in the future\"\" still isn't too bad because it's correct. Even if the docking adapters never existed in the first place, the statement is still true. Even if there was no USOS, the statement is still true. You see what I mean ? It could happen, doesn't mean it will, it doesn't rule out or rule in any possibilities, sure we could endlessly qualify it like \"\"the Shenzhou spacecraft could to dock at the International Space Station if it becomes politically feasible in the future, so long as the station is not deorbited first, or has it's budget cut, or the APAS's are covered, mangled, sold, ejected, stolen by Ivan Ivanovich, america doesn't declare war on china, ESA doesn't declare martial law on columbus\"\" and so forth. It's just that it's a correct statement as is, plus, short and sweet. I'm very happy that what you are saying is correct, and belongs somewhere with other future maybe plans, however it has little to do with china because the docking is already tenuous at best, and so not going to happen in the next few years, and if it does, they will need to prepare anyway. So where is the article that outlines a hypothetical docking to the ISS to tell us where it is or isn't ? It's pretty much all speculation and too far out on a limb to outline such hypothetical within the China section, better to just mention the hypothetical possibility of docking as a point of interest and move on with the now and is. The location of the hypothetical docking would be subject to political pressures, like if ESA and RSA forced america to agree, by no longer provisioning services like transport, then it would be ROS docking, but if the US and China made up it would be an american module docking, and so forth, hardware would be provisioned to reflect the nature of the political decision.

      "I wanted to add something about the “Persian or Farsi” controversy, but first wanted to consult everyone on this. Let’s talk about both, the pros and the cons, and keep it impartial. There are valuable issues raised by renowned Persian scholars. I quote from an article on the same subject:\n",
      "\n",
      "→ Identity Aspect: The word Persian in the mind of an English speaker, consciously or not, recalls many other historical and cultural legacies about Iran. Persian is closely associated with Persian poetry, Persian carpets/rugs, Persian cats, Persian poetry, Persian pistachios, and so on. When you refer to this language as Persian, the audience may associate it with one or more of these relevant ideas. On the contrary, the word Farsi not only voids these historical and cultural associations, but it also adds to the recent portrayal of Iran as a strange and distant society.\n",
      "\n",
      "→ Calling Persian as Farsi, is as incorrect as calling the Persian Gulf as the Farsi Gulf. Moreover, the name Farsi is obscure and under the best conditions refers only to certain dialects such as the Persian of Iran as opposed to Tajiki, the Persian of Tajikistan or Dari, the Persian of Afghanistan, or even one may say Isfahani, the Persian of Isfahan. \n",
      "\n",
      "→ The use of word Farsi in English strikes a discordant tone to the native speaker. Imagine someone speaking in English about their recent trip to Paris saying, \"\"I went to Paris and there I spoke Francais.\"\" (Instead of saying French). To use the word Farsi has the same impact and may sound not only pretentious at times but also destructive of English syntax.\n",
      "\n",
      "We should therefore avoid the use of the word Farsi instead of Persian because it not only violates historical fact but also some of the regularities of the language in which we speak. I believe that Persian is the true and proper name of this language in foreign tongues and international communities and changing it does not benefit the representation of Iranian culture.\"\n",

English cuisine, Cantonese cuisine, Vietnamese cuisine, etc.). I agree that there should be a separate article for the cuisine of ethnic Hawaiians, but the other article should not be about colonial Hawaiian cuisine; it should be called Cuisine of Hawaii and be about the cuisine of the island of Hawaii, documenting all the cuisines found there, including ethnic Hawaiian cuisine. It will not be a parent article for the ethnic Hawaiian cuisine article because that article will include the introduction of Hawaiian cuisine into other regions of the world. 2) The name of the article about the cuisine of ethnic Hawaiians should remain at Hawaiian cuisine, not be moved to Native Hawaiian cuisine.

So, if the player does not know where the car is placed, or the host's door opening strategy, the probability of winning by switching is exactly 2/3.  It may be that the car is always placed behind door 2 and the host always opens door 3 but, if we do not know that, it makes no difference to our (Bayesian) probability calculation, which depends by definition only on the information that we have, .  The concept of average probability makes no sense, there is just 'the probability' which is based only on our state of knowledge.\n",

More specifically, we are investigating whether content from news sources can be used to enhance Wikipedia editing. We have created a tool, called wikiFeed, that allows you to specify Twitter and/or RSS feeds from news sources that are interesting to you. wikiFeed then helps you make connections between those feeds and Wikipedia articles. We believe that using this tool may be a lot of fun, and may help you come up with some ideas on how to contribute to Wikipedia in ways that interest you. Please participate! To do so, complete this survey and follow this link to our website. Once you're there, click the \"\"create an account\"\" link to get started.\n",

To conclude that a person’s statements must have been made under oath before they can be used to corroborate anything – let alone an event that is independently captured on film (and which lends credibility to the waiters’ accounts itself) – is nothing short of a fiction. I strongly recommend that you re-read WP:CITE and WP:RS. I haven’t dug around for mainstream media outlets reporting the news or the video and its authenticity for that matter (primarily because I just don’t care enough at the moment), but rest assured that if they have or do, I will recognize – compliant with Wikipedia guidelines – any Wikipedian’s citation of it.

I saw your link to the warehouse talk and I am very pleased that someone has tracked down this extra match at the Dutch round robin. I use to think this was a 4 man rr, but found out it was 8 man with 2 groups of 4 earlier this year. There were some upsets at this event with Ralston  beating Rosewall on clay.

To me there is a close relation between a racket like this one and spiritualism, for example. Holocaust zealots trap their revisionist critics in much the same way that the spiritualists treated their scoffers during their heyday...The 'Hoaxers' do much the same thing: the more outrageous of the Holocaust atrocities they endlessly circulate don't have to be proven. Instead, it is up to those who deny they happened to prove they did not...One of these days I should try to get a foundation to underwrite a trip to central Africa. After returning I would announce that I had encountered a tribe of talking monkeys, and then challenge anyone who does not believe me to prove otherwise.\"\" (See: http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v12/v12p245_Letters.html#Martin)\n",

      "Let me first of all set the record straight about the history of the relationship between myself and User:Jza84. On his talk page Jza84 states 'I hardly know the editor bar an passing in a discussion from time to time'. As Mangojuice notes on that same page, 'Jza clearly knows Enaidmawr is a long-time established editor here; Jza interacted with Enaidmawr as early as November 2007, over 6 months before Jza became an admin.' That interaction was courteous and constructive and repeated on a number of occasions. I wouldn't claim that we were regular collaborators, but collaborate we did, and if somebody had aske me, before this incident, 'do you know this editor and do you have a good working relationship with him?' I would have replied in the affirmative, without hesitation. The only real \"\"edit conflict\"\" I had with him prior to this was in February of this year, at British Day. This was resolved civilly and without rancour, although I have to admit that I found his attitude at the time patronising - \"\"A lesson would be it took all of five minutes to strengthen the article up with a few references.\"\" - and felt that the zealousy with which he reacted to my edits - an effort to bring balance to a biased account, in my opinion, for what it's worth - whilst ignoring a number of dubious and unsourced statements and peacock terms for the opposing view of the subject, was unbalanced. However, I refrained from comment (see Brit Day in his talk page archive). 'Everybody is entitled to their views', I said to myself, and moved on. I'll admit that I tended to avoid him after that as I had no wish to get embroiled in anything: I've got better things to do. I could have responded to this comment on Talk:Newport which I found to be deeply insulting to all Welsh people: saying that Daicaregos was 'an advocate of \"\"Welsh nationality\"\" (which doesn't exist, verifiabily)(). That statement left me with the indelible impression that Jza84 denied the nationality of myself and all Welsh people. I thought that was a very hurtful comment and completely unnecessary and I am sure that most Welsh people would feel the same way. However, once again I did not respond even though I was part of that discussion and was sorely tempted to do so: 'Ignore it', I told myself. Shortly later I became aware of a series of edits by Jza84 removing Welsh nationality and replacing it with 'British' on a number of articles on my watchlist; amongst them was the article on Dafydd Wigley, Plaid Cymru's senior statesman. Rightly or wrongly, I was by then convinced that Jza84 had a personal agenda on this matter. I reverted some edits and ignored others not on my watchlist as I genuinely did not want to get involved in a dispute (and no, it had nothing to do with his admin status). However, when I saw his edit to Template:Welsh kingdoms, also on my watchlist, I will admit that I was incensed. I reacted with less tact than I should have done, I admit. I reverted his edit. Changing 'Welsh kingdoms' to the woefully incorrect and insulting 'Brittonic petty kingdoms of Wales' seemed to me to confirm my impression of him: it basically de-Cymricised the major kingdoms of medieval Wales, which have a central place in our history and identity, used a term which is both incorrect and open to misinterpretation by the general reader (not everyone is aware of the meaning of the rather obsolete and affected term 'petty kingdom'). He than undid my edit and came up with the wording 'Ancient kingdoms of Wales', which is again quite simply incorrect ('medieval' is not 'ancient'). Then I read his \"\"explanation\"\" on the talk page. Quite frankly I thought he was taking the mickey. It also confirmed me in my opinion that he had an agenda of denying the Welsh people their identity (quote: 'What exactly are the Welsh kingdoms? Kingdoms inhabited by the Welsh?  Well, no, the Welsh are a modern nation who live in Wales. Are they subdivisions of Wales?  Well, also no, these kingdoms pre-date Wales by centuries (Wales was a concept of the future!'). 'What fools historians, Welsh and others, have been to refer to such icons of Welsh history as Llywelyn the Great as Welsh (and his court poets who praised him as 'King of the Welsh' etc.)', I said to myself. At that point I should have taken a deep breath and walked away to make a coffee, count to several thousand and then respond. But I did not, and the result is this. That sets the record straight. I've already apologised for any offense I may have caused and given my opinion of Jza84's decision. I write this to let my peers who have commented and acted on the matter get the 'history' behind this incident from my point of view. I do not intend to respond here to other things which have been said or implied here and at Jza8\n",

      "\n",
      "In violation of the Brest-Litovsk Peace Treaty with soviet Russia, Turkish troops crossed the border in 1918 and attacked Alexandropol (Leninakan). The aggressor intended to crush Eastern Armenia and seize Transccaucasia. When Alexandropol fell, the Turkish Army poured into the Ararat Valley – the heart of Armenia. There was a major engagement at Sardarabad on May 22-26, where the Turkish Army was defeated and retreated.  \n",

      "First of all I do not know how to revert. I just make changes. Second as I am trying to put this version, a very good guy, named roob323 reverts to an older Turkish version of the site. Moreover, now it sounds even ridiculous.The same thing they wrote twice. Just by cutting and pasting from the history of the article. These kids who never went to school in Armenia, whose knowledge about Armenian history comes from church sunday schools write things that can couse laugh even in Turkish readers. For example, in early May recently becamed independent Armenia was attacked by Ottoman forces ( Armenia Georgia and Azerbaijan decalred their independence only in the end of May). Or, after losing the battle of Sardarapat, Armenia declared its independence (second time as a matter of fact). But we all know that the second time Armenia declared its Sovetization (occupation by bolsheviks) on November 29,1920 and not independence. It is very well known that the commander in the battle of Sardarapat was Daniel Bek Pirumov from the village of Nakhichevanik in Nagorno Karabakh. SO fat these 2 imbeciles named Nareklm and roob keep pushing the name Slkuni or Silician.  And finall,y who needs the aftermath of the battle in Sardarapat if it concludes information about what Georgia did, who it asked for help etc etc etc. I am surprized to find out from the article edited by roob and narek that Turkish army occupied the whole Armenia(including Russian part which is todays Armenia). Probably Nagorno Karabakh or Zangezur or Sevan they do not consider a part of Armenia anymore. Moreover, in the history of this article also edited by some turks and Narek you can find out that Armenia was forced to sign treaty of Batumi!!!!!You can see how come 3 not literate (angraget in Armenian) imbeciles can come and do things in wikipedia that Turkish and Azeri propagandists could not even see in their dreams. Because these 3 imbeciles have got a right to revert edit or even block others, the real Armenian history specialists can get heart attacks if they read this article. Does anybody watch in Armenia what is going on here?\n",

      "\"::I am surprised you dispute whether or not the Analects contain music criticism when this is so widely written about. Your criticism of Steben’s 2010 paper, “The Philosophy of Music and Ritual in Pre-Han Confucian Thought” http://www.academia.edu/1929545/The_Philosophy_of_Music_and_Ritual_in_Pre-Han_Confucian_Thought_Exalting_the_Power_of_Music_in_Human_Life) for not using the word “criticism” is as unsupportable as your insistence on the word “theory.” Lest we devolve into absurd arguments about the definition of “criticism,” In general, the word is defined as “The action of criticizing, or passing judgment on the qualities or merits of anything….” (The Philological Society, ed. The Oxford English Dictionary, Vol II C, Oxford at the Clarendon Press, 1970, p.1181). With regard to music specifically, “The Oxford Companion to Music” defines it, in specific regard to music, as: “…the intellectual activity of formulating judgments on the value and degree of excellence of individual works of music, or whole groups or genres.”(Latham, ed. Oxford University Press, 2002, p.324) Steben’s paper then clearly describes Confucius’ criticism. As another example, WP’s article on Yayue refers to Confucius’ writing: “The term yayue itself first appeared in the Analects,[2][3] where yayue was considered by Confucius to be the kind of music that is good and beneficial, in contrast to the popular music originated from the state of Zheng which he judged to be decadent and corrupting.[4][5] Yayue is therefore regarded in the Confucian system as the proper form of music that is refined, improving, and essential for self-cultivation, and one that can symbolize good and stable governance.[6][7] “ The Analects contain music criticism whether the word “criticism” appears or not. I think you may be the only person around who thinks otherwise. In the future, if you make assertions like, “You claim that \"\"Confucius' Analects is, in regard to music, criticism\"\"; but the reference that you quote in support of your claim utterly fails to actually support it, because it merely never speaks of criticism,” please cite a reference to support your argument. Your continuing argument that a thing cannot be accepted as theoretical unless it specifically uses the word “theory” is similarly problematic because it is not supported anywhere that I can find. Throughout or discussion, I’ve pointed you to references that contradict your personal opinion. If you have a reference for your opinion, please cite. Jacques Bailhé \n",

I do however believe the entire reporting process is better served if this unintentional obstruction is corrected. Regardless of whether or not a report would have been more appropriately filed somewhere else, the misplaced report having been filed in good faith, deserves to receive the attention on an admin. Honestly, I would expect an admin to rather zealously ensure, that they weren't taken out of the loop, by the flaw of an automated process. I believe the timestamp should be compared, and if the report is after the block in place, the report should stay. Manually remove if without action, or when the block is modified, the Bot would remove it then. Unless it was a technical challenge beyond what I can fathom, I see little reason not to. And I know a couple tool admins who love to hate fixing code. So I stand upon the initial belief that this is a problematic condition, I am curious if there is something I am missing entirely?

      "\n",

      "Maybe you should compare your proposal to the big drive to address Un-Referenced Biographies of Living People (URBLP)s, a problem that was recognized more and more during 2009, and then blew up in controversy in January 2010, I think it was.  There was one editor deleting them by the hundreds, I think, which made others mad.  And Wikipedia was hammered in the outside news coverage about some salient bad incidents.  The problem was addressed by a big drive, with one element being wp:URBLP Wikiproject's efforts that I happened to join.  The drive was well-focused because there was a known number, 52,000, of unreferenced BLPs in a category, to be addressed, (although there were new ones coming in, and more old ones being discovered of course).  And that one editor agreed to back off, IF the number was reduced by half in six months.  That's my very imperfect understanding of the situation before I joined.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The drive I participated in worked well.  I tried to help keep focus on the goal, and in several other ways, but some others had far more direct impact than I did.  See Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Unreferenced Biographies of Living Persons/Archive 2#Goal statement.  Every day we could see the current number, and it moving or not, and some big changes were made to reduce the number of new URBLPs coming in, and some other targeted efforts were tried and some clearly made a difference while others did not.  Overall, having the big, numeric public goal that we wanted to meet, and having immediate feedback/gratification in seeing the total category's number change, was key.  It was rewarding and frustrating and a team effort going on, etc., not just a bunch of people working completely separately.  In the end the 6 month goal was finally met though it was very close.  Then I and some others dropped out but the overall problem had been somewhat \"\"solved\"\", and it's been better since, and the number was brought all the way down to 0 effectively, and is at about 2,000 now, I see. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not saying you should talk much or at all about that URBLP problem and its drive, in your opinion piece. But I think your calling for accurate measurement of the current problem, by a one-month effort to get all of the problematic articles tagged, say, the same way, would be reasonable.  There would have to be an enforceable rule made up, that prevented the paid PR persons from deleting the tags on their articles.  There was something like that with the URBLPs...I think anyone seen deleting the URBLP tag was warned and blocked as disruptive if necessary.  And then you can call for something aggressive:  like bringing the \"\"real\"\" number down to 100,000 tops within a year, or whatever.  Your estimating the problem size to be 150,000 is helpful towards setting that up.  Or you could call for something quite different.  My main reaction, anyhow, was that I expected at the end for you to call for something big.  Asking people to separately make efforts that would not even be measurable, would not be enough, IMO.  You've earned the right to call for a bigger more organized effort.\n",

This page, like many pages of strong national interest to certain users, will forever be a battleground. I'm sure you've seen it elsewhere as well  there is a cadre of users who post on one topic only, and large numbers of them congregate around a topic of interest. They post a certain perspective on the topic, and basically exert ownership over the topic. People who come in and see what might be considered to be bias, and try to change the page, are quickly overwhelmed. Even when they are not, and achieve some sort of compromise after a long struggle, sooner or later a new account will arrive and undo the consensus.  This is exactly what happened here.

It would be a bit similar to the \"\"Last of the Time Lords\"\" one we fought over so hard, but unlike in that case, here you'd actually have the \"\"critical analysis\"\" in place, because the scene is covered substantially, and not just in the sense of a renarration of the plot. How about one of those with Rose holding the dying Doctor in her arms, like here, caption along the lines of: \"\"The climactic final scene, described as a \"\"bitter moment of high emotion\"\", as the Doctor is seemingly dying in Rose's arms. (bah, a bit long, but you get my drift.) (Trouble is, if you want it in the infobox, you'll probably want a longish caption to make the analytic significance transparent. In my opinion at least, it really helps if the caption refers explicitly to the analytic aspect, rather than just to the plot.)  ☼ \n",

It broke Brazil's 62-match home unbeaten streak in competitive matches going back to 1975, and equalled their biggest margin of defeat, tied with a 6–0 loss to Uruguay in 1920, leading it to be described as a national humiliation. The game also saw Germany score the most goals in World Cup history, their 223 overtaking Brazil's 221. Their second goal meant Germany's Miroslav Klose reached 16 World Cup goals, overtaking Brazil's Ronaldo as the tournament's all-time record goalscorer. The game was subsequently referred to by the press as the Mineirazo, evoking the spirit of the Maracanazo in which Brazil unexpectedly lost the 1950 FIFA World Cup on home soil to Uruguay.\"\n",

My extender had an IP on the wrong subnet (192.168.0.123, when all my other devices were on the 192.168.1.* subnet), so I regained access by factory resetting and changing the static IP to 192.168.1.123.  Since you can't get on even after a factory reset, you could try modifyin your router DHCP settings so that the subnet it's assigning everything to includes the static IP you assigned for the extender (and if that still doesn't work, the factory default).  Assuming the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, then this just means the first 3 sections of the IP need to be the same.\n",

But I'll address the specific points you've made:\n",
      "While I didn't make the Mac Observer edit myself so I can't speak for the original editor, but I believe the point of the citation wasn't so much to make any particular point about the accuracy of Enderle's predictions (though I suppose that could be implied), but to point out how often Enderle has predicted Apple's failure, if not demise. Though more importantly, it illustrates that Enderle is target of criticism, deserved or otherwise. And I don't see how you could question the Death Knell Counter's credibility, when it links directly to cited articles. And I have no earthly idea why you quoted the policy on academic journals when we're talking about the validity of an internet site list (which itself is subject to scrutiny from the site's editors and readers).\n",
      "The operative term in the policy you quote is \"\"disproportionate\"\", which is to say, if an article's subject is subject of overwhelming criticism, than it makes sense for criticisms to dominate the article, and conversely, if the subject receives mostly praise, then it doesn't make sense for the article to be negative. But the way the article was before you erased the paragraph about the criticism seemed to be fairly balanced, with his accomplishments and prominence receiving the majority of coverage. And again, if he has his defenders/apologists, then feel free to cite them. Your edits aren't so much eliminating disproportionate criticisms, but whitewashing the article.\n",
      "I do not beleive that WP:NPOV gives a particular editor the right to outsource their WP:NPOV responsibility to another editor. - you clearly misunderstand the policy and the reason for my edits. Criticism against Enderle exists. Those criticism against Enderle come from prominent sources. Again, accurate or not, criticism from notable sources should be in the article. That you referred to Gruber as \"\"a John Doe\"\" suggests that you don't know enough about him to make any judgment about his notability, and your characterizing Gruber's criticisms of Enderle as \"\"personal attacks\"\" tells me you didn't read the cited posts carefully. \n",
      " The Gruber and Death Knell citations were properly sourced. They, in turn, linked to specific Enderle quotes that they criticize.

      "\n",
      "As already mentioned above the legal status of this constabulary IS a grey area.  I am a serving officer in the Met and many of my colleagues are unaware of the powers and remit of borough constabularies such as the WPP.  If serving front line police officers are unsure, then I have to say there is a definite grey area for the public.  I have done some research and discovered some interesting points which the article does not in its present form represent.  As a result, I and it would appear an anon editor have edited the article to try and make a better and objective article which reflects reality.  As it was, the article was subjective and questionable.  However these edits have been reverted without explanation – apart from comments such as ‘this is the truth’.  In effort to explain my edits and prevent an edit war I set out below my reason for altering the article. \n",
      "\n",
      "London Borough Parks Constabularies are, as is correctly quoted, established under sec 18 of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government Provision Order Confirmation 1967.  This act allows London borough councils to establish a body of constables who have the power to enforce parks bye-laws in their respective parks.  It does not make these constables ‘police constables’ and does not allow police services or forces to be established.  No police powers are given to these parks constables (with the exception of parks bye laws) over and above those which everybody is entitled, often referred to as ‘any person’ powers or as in the case of arrest, ‘citizen’s arrest’.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In comparison, officers from Home Office forces (such as the Met, Kent Police etc) can point to the Police Act 1996 as the basis for their establishment, jurisdiction and powers as police constables.  BTP officers can point to the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003.  Ministry of Defence Police officer can point to the Ministry of Defence Police Act 1986.  I could go on…My point is that all these police forces have a legal basis and with the attached powers to call themselves police officers and the organisations they work for police services/forces.  The WPP does not, unless someone can point to a piece of legislation that I have missed.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the article started by saying, “Wandsworth Parks Police is a Police Service successfully run…”.  Two points about the opening sentence.  Firstly, its NOT legally a police service but a borough parks constabulary.  Secondly, the comment regarding ‘successfully run’ is highly subjective and without basis.  All organisations would like to be thought of a successful, but without any citation it should not be in an encyclopaedic article.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under legal status the paragraph starts by mentioning the Met and working closely with it.  Irrelevant to legal status me thinks and again subjective.  Why mention a home office force in the legal status paragraph of a parks constabulary.  This paragraph should merely be about the legal status of WPP and its constables.  The paragraph rightly states that a magistrate swears WPP constables in, but not as ‘police constables’ but as ‘parks constables’ due to the legislation involved.  Once sworn in the parks constables have executive powers to enforce parks bye-laws in their boroughs ONLY.  Criminal law is not included.  However, just like the general public, parks constables can enforce criminal law in certain limited circumstances relating to indictable offences only.  This is commonly known as ‘citizens arrest’.  Due to changes in arrest powers with SOCAP in 2006, non police officers, such as parks constables need to be aware of the necessity criteria to make an arrest lawful.  My point is that the article read like the parks constables had police powers – they don’t (apart from the bye law aspect).  The paragraph then goes on to state that parks constables come under PACE.  Well this is obvious and irrelevant, any arrest by anyone is under PACE (as amended by SOCAP).  What it doesn’t do is give parks constables any more power than Joe Public (apart from the bye law aspect).  For all the above reasons, the last sentence of this paragraph (“They are always Parks Police Officers regardless of the technicalities of whether or not they are in the act of enforcing bye-laws.”) is not a true reflection of law and quite frankly wrong and misleading.  There is no such thing as a parks ‘police officer’. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had added at the bottom of the article two paragraphs with cited evidence which brings into question the status of parks constabularies and their use of the word ‘police’, blue lights and use of batons etc.  These were deleted without reason.  They are legitimate sources which shed light on the grey area.  You may not agree with the report and committee’s results but they are in the public domain and support my contention that there IS a grey area and WPP are treading on thin ice on occasion.\n",

Oh well, he's probably rich as it gets the way the company praises them like he's God so I suppose it doesn't really matter to him. I just have a problem getting the whole 90s Undertaker vibe when he pulls off his top and raises his arm, then pulls it back on and falls to one knee worshipping the urn and Paul bearer that aren't there. That's another thing, Paul Bearer with all the faces throughout the entrace, pulling off of the coat, using the power of the urn was a big part of that whole character. I think he should just give up on being the Undertaker because he isnt' scarying anyone anymore. That character was a good one that was meant to be scary, not changed into all sorts of rockers.

While many researchers consider AS and HFA to be so similar that there is no point in even distinguishing between them, there is at least a significant minority who have championed the continuing existence of AS as a distinct diagnosis. If we treat studies on persons who were diagnosed with autistic disorder as if they had been diagnosed with AS, we implicitly bias the article in favor of the one viewpoint. So, even though I happen to believe that AS and HFA are the same in most important aspects, I intend to go through this article and weed out the bias. AS may not be very well researched, but there is not such a dearth of information that we are compelled to introduce large amounts of material on arguably different topics.\n",

The entire history section of this article is still in very bad shape in my opinion, I'd suggest that its got non NPOV issues in several spots, the tone it's written in and choice of words seem somewhat \"\"chatty\"\" and unencyclopedic to me and worst of all it continues to contain, what I'd argue, are historical inaccuracies in some places. Instead of editing out the paragraph that was removed today, which contained a link to a map, as well as an internal link to the ongoing Caledonia land dispute, a subject quite relevant in the Grand Valley these days, I'd like to see the entire history section itself brought up to a higher standard. In my opinion, from a historical perspective, the article itself would benefit more if some of the earlier comments in it regarding the acquisition of the land by the Six Nations were edited out and replaced by the material that was removed today. As I said back in August, I'm willing to work on this article myself as time allows, but in my opinion it doesn't make sense removing content that's not only relevant and contains references, it's actually of a higher quality than what remains.\n",

It's crucial that the definition be as precise as possible in emphasizing that PED is concerned only with changes in quantity demanded.  (Elasticity is one of the most difficult concepts in micro for most beginning students and for other potential readers/users  WP's \"\"customers\"\"; they tend to get confused by the slightest ambiguity about which quantity we mean.  An ounce of emphasis here doesn't preclude such confusion, but it can help avoid a pound of it.)\n",

Although the Giffen and Veblen exceptions are interesting, they are almost negligibly rare anomalies compared to the overwhelming number of typical goods and services governed by the Law of Demand.  (That's why it merits the rare status of a \"\"Law\"\"!)  The exceptions deserve discussion eventually (in a later section), but I think this introductory paragraph would be strengthened by giving them only the briefest possible mention in passing here.  Instead, this paragraph should focus attention on the crux of the issue that readers need to remember (the \"\"take-away\"\"), namely:  because the demand for most goods and services obeys the Law of Demand, their PED coefficients will always be negative.  \n",

It doesn't serve this section or the article well to risk distracting students and other readers from the main point too early with such minor exceptions, however interesting they may be to the intellectually curious readers.

The most infamous ship is that of the 'Zutara' ship. As the portmanteau  name implies, the ship involves the characters Zuko and Katara, and was first catalyzed by Zuko tying Katara to a try and attempting to bribe her with the necklace of her deceased mother in 'The Waterbending Scroll'. One way or another, it has grown to be one of the most recognizable ship, and also helping it was the fact that the two voice actors shared a parallel relationship on another show, 'American Dragon Jake Long'. Regardless of it origins, due to being known to regularly visits their fansites and forums, the creators are quite aware of the ship or at least seem to enjoy playing with it, as it has been mentioned in almost every interview/convention.

      "Kelly knew what color her eyes were when she made the song \"\"Behind These Hazel Eyes\"\". Comparing the pictures of Kelly and Belle, they do seem to share the same eye color just slightly different shades of it - Belle's eyes are little lighter. Someone made a video called \"\"Behind Belle's Hazel Eyes\"\", the person who made this video knew what color Belle's eyes were and decided to include Belle's name in the title. And if you read the comments, the people fully agree her eyes are hazel with comments like \"\"green or hazel? they look more hazel than brown or green . yup belles﻿ eyes are deffinetely hazel problem solved\"\". I like the \"\"problem solved\"\" part. With Minotaurgirl's bias against the idea of Belle having hazel eyes, I think there will always be a problem with people like her involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "TV Tropes has already suffered an edit war because of her, so much so they forbade users from writting what Belle's eye color is. Notice how Belle's name is missing from the Eye Color tropes colony, while the rest of Disney Princesses have their eye color mentioned. Belle's name was there under the category of Hazel Eyes until Minotaurgirl came along and ruined it all. Same thing almost happened to Disney Wiki. This is Minotaurgirl's account, as you can see she got blocked with an expiry time of infinite, the reason; inserting false information, the false information being writting down Belle's eyes as brown.] And now here's Minotaurgirl on the Wikipedia. Is there any repsite from her?\n",
      "\n",
      "I noticed she has a Live Journal account. See what she has written. The lack of links speaks for itself. She thinks she actually proved Belle's eyes are brown, depsite the fact what she has presented as evidence is either a minority or a plain old lie, like the screenshots she send me. By magnifying the images, you can see her eyes are hazel-colored and not the same color as her hair at all. Notice how she's afriad to use close-ups of Belle's eye cuz she knows they'll appear hazel if she did so, thus disproving her. On her blog, she didn't mention that she was blocked on Disney Wiki, and said the only reason Disney Wiki kept Belle's eyes color as hazel was to shut up people who keep writting her eyes as hazel, when in reality the one who got shut up was Minotaurgirl as she got blocked while the others didn't. She wrote \"\"Bleh. Kids these days. This one needs a hobby. I'm tired of wasting time trying to undo this snot's damage, and I'm fairly sure the mods of these sites are too. Would it be possible to just...block this person off the internet entirely until they learn some manners?\"\" Yup, she calls people who use logic and legitimate evidence to prove their point snots and hobby-less kids if the evidence goes against what Minotaurgirl said/believes.\n",
      "\n",
      "If anyone deserves to be blocked, it's Minotaurgirl. If it wasn't for her bias, sites like like TV Tropes, Disney Wiki and the Wikipedia wouldn't have suffered an edit war about Belle's eye color. The fact that there was never an edit about Belle's eye color until Minotaurgirl came along, says a lot. Ever since she got blocked from Disney Wiki almost an year ago, no edit war about Belle's eye color happened there either. It's like Minotaurgirl is the only person on the entire internet who refuses to accept Belle's eyes as hazel and is willing to go to every page and change her eye color to brown, just cuz she likes to think so, not because the world thinks so or any legit evidence are presented. It's like someone going around changing Ariel's eyes from blue to green, just cuz he likes the idea of Ariel being green-eyed. Thinks don't work like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "My overall opinion on Minotaurgurl. I think it's safe to say the interent is better off without her. She's toxic, she's a nuisance, she's talks trash to people just cuz they disagree with her, she lies, she mangles, twists and misrepresents other people's words, and she causes edit wars. Action needs to be taken against people like this.  \"\n",

The figures currently quoted in the articles up to 1996 are usually \"\"estimates\"\" that have been taken from various charts message boards, calculated by enthusiasts from officially published yearly sales figures per artist (i.e. sales could be made up of one or more singles or albums, and estimating what percentage of sales were assigned to each record). As these are completely unofficial and unverifiable, I am thinking to remove them altogether or at least add a note that all figures are unofficial and estimated. In any case I don't think most people are interested in how many records the 37th best selling album of 1987 sold that year – it makes more sense to me to concentrate efforts into keeping List of best-selling singles in the United Kingdom up to date.   \"\n",

The problem is that the object of the sentence is \"\"Penn\"\" and without knowing that he said, \"\"they\"\" you're expecting him to use a first person singular, not a first person plural. I think the reason it feels awkward is that when it undergoes the transformation from singular to plural it does become slightly more ambiguous, because \"\"we\"\" refers to a group of people, but only one that includes Penn, which means it's either Penn & Teller or the entire production staff of the show. When you go to \"\"they\"\", it could be any group of people, and because it doesn't say \"\"he\"\", you sort of need to think about what other possible groups Penn could be referring to. Obviously it only takes a few milliseconds to figure out what it means, but if you're reading along at full speed it can break the flow to have that happen.\n",

      "Regarding the colon wording (Penn said: \"\"the aim of the show is to ..\"\"), I understand what  is going for there, but I don't like the way it sounds in that paragraph. When you do it that way, it seems like a non-sequitur. When you have it the other way, it's clear that we, the editors of the encyclopedia, are trying to convey to the readers what the aim of the show is, and we're using Penn's words. When you just say that Penn said something, and the thing that he said is about the aim of the show, the role of that sentence in the paragraph becomes a bit more ambiguous, because it could be that we are trying to convey that this is how Penn thinks about the show, or that we're trying to convey something about Penn himself. I think the way it's written now and where the quote starts removes nearly all that ambiguity. But of course, I could be reading into things way too much. I think it feels natural with the \"\"we\"\" being included in the quote, but maybe  has a better compromise wording that addresses my concerns about non-sequitur.  [talk/contrib] \"\n",

Of course, the Republican legality was not restored, but that was because it had not proven safe from revolutionary risks. And Monarchy was not restored probably because King Alfonso XIII fled the country only because his partisans lost a municipal ballot, so it appeared to the victors in the war that that king was not reliable to grant individual rights.

Typically, a being from the Reverse Maruhage can only individually teleport back and forth between dimensions (we see when Crimson, LOVE and the Sacks return to the Dark World, they use a teleporter that allows them to raise and fall between the surface).  My assumption is that an object such as the Yamiking needs a lot of energy to rise up to the main world compared to the limited amount of energy that individuals can use.  Thus, the Table of Sacrifices is needed to gather energy from twelve individuals (in the form of a clock) to power the Yamiking.  After the Sacks summon the clock, Crimson and LOVE throw over defeated opponents (already known to be really strong since they made it to the final stage of the playoff) into each number, with the assumption that their great energy will siphon from the clock to the Yamiking. -\n",

If the article isnt balanced then it has a nnpov.

That's his right to do so if he wants to and he should not get into trouble because of it, since, last I checked, the 1st amendment was still valid in America (or so they say). What next?

      "The admin User:Deacon of Pndapetzim must have his adminship fully questioned in the correct place. No one has a chance on Wikipedia when an admin acts (and wheel wars) like he has done – and I believe he has overstepped the line, and made a difficult but legal situation into a nightmare situation for everyone. I warned him of the mayhem that would be caused if Ireland was simply reverted into being a cultural all-island article, but he ignored me. This edit note (and selective deletion) is an example of the kind of intellectual demeaning by admin that lead to me losing my own temper. You cannot treat adults like children. It shows feelings of superiority in being an admin - which must not be condoned. Aside from his attitude, the way he reversed admin Tariqabjotu's Ireland Move, citing a very small hand-picked selection of admin who share his personal position on this - to his own personal wishes, was totally unacceptable. Where were all the other admin I saw who spoke up? For reasons I give after after I get the following paragraph off my chest, he completely shattered Wikipedia for me when he did that, and his reasoning for doing it showed it to be nothing other than an act of hypocrisy, as well as self interest. Arbitration are not there to be interested themselves (by their own admission) - they are only there to be there, and there is nowhere else now to to go. It has all been completely messed up now – so Arbcom has to be pulled in.\n",
      "\n",
      "I regret that I am leaving Wikipedia with the worse kind of people in my mind, in a place that is actually full of fantastic unacknowledged philanthropy. I won't go the way of saying what I (100%, in all good faith, IMHO, genuinely, without doubt etc, etc) honestly think this is comparable to - people call it a 'Godwin', a commonly-used term which belittles the technical purity of the very example - an early internet 'battle' won by some clever person, for sure. But you have to think beyond the cliche. The talk-page admin 'cop out' over any car crash, is normally to pretend this place is just a pastime, but WIkipedia is a little more important than that - no? And conspiracy theorising - don't point that one at me – it us such an ugly slur. Who needs those, when you give ‘’individuals’’ so much power? People group - they always do. The only 'conspiracy' could be within wondering why Wikipedia has to be structured in this way. It's a Sunday drive, and includes the world - but anything difficult like this? The structure simply breaks down. So do some people want a loose ship? A negative answer would have little to do with the Irelands anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two wrongs don't make a right, and equally bad is a wrong made after a right. Now how was Deacon right? The first move to Ireland disam/(state)/(island) was rational and sound 'policy-over-polling', the reversal (in the horrendous way it was done) was wrong in every possible way. Those who were interested in doing so, simply needed to re-debate it from where it was (perhaps prove it in a global poll?). But why should I do even more work towards facilitating that? I have given hundreds of hours of my life to this already. And where now were those originally opposing? A number of them were addressing new content.

      "First off, we are not discussing 2015, we are discussing 2016; that much should be obvious. Second, the fact that we've always done things a certain way does not erase the possibility of improving our process. I would argue, and I'd hope you would agree, that these articles have only gotten better over time. That improvement did not happen because we sat on our hands and were content with the level of quality we had already reached. Third, I do not think Lotus/Renault and Marussia/Manor are relevant situations to each other. With Lotus, we know the Renault takeover is going to be done, and we know the name will be changed. Both have been confirmed. With Marussia, as F1 fans we know the name was only kept to keep their FOM TV rights money, and we have every reason to believe it will be changed now that Marussia is entirely out of the picture, but that's nonetheless original research that isn't fit for this article. I now agree that I was wrong to fight for the Renault name, but Lotus is equally wrong. We have no specific confirmation of the former, but we do have confirmation that it won't be the latter. So what we know for sure is very little - in fact, I believe all we know is the drivers and the engine. That that's why it should say TBA-Lotus. Additionally, think of it from this perspective: a person reads a news article announcing that the Renault takeover has been completed. They read another story from the head of Renault Sport indicating the Lotus team name will be dropped. These articles are from reliable sources and feature direct quotes. They then come here and see...Lotus. Their only reaction is going to be that Wikipedia is clearly wrong. And they're right to think that. And if you DON'T agree that reliably reported quotes from the head of organizations are good enough sources for Wikipedia, then there's quite a lot that needs to be removed from this article. You can't have it both ways.\n",
